INTRODUCT 10N. 1 1

behind him ¹. The same disgrace had besallen Aloeeus,
a more warlike pcet; but it is unreasonable to suppose
that Horace was a coward. A youth of three and twenty,
without personal interest, and destitute of military knowledge
would not have been put into so responsible a position
unless he had a reputation at least for bravery. Horace writes
ploesantly of his disaster, and cowards do not dwell on their
own discomfiture. He did not, however, ‘drist back into
the tide os war,’ like his friend Pompeius Varus (to
whom the poem quoted below is addressed), but returned
to Italy ‘with his wings clipped.’ His estate had been
confiscated by the victors, and for some years he lived
a lise of stmggling poverty ². He had enough money to
purchase a place as scriba or public clerk in the treasury³3
and in later lise this guild of public servants used to consult
him on matters of importance ¹. But poverty gave hardi-
hood, as he says, and he wrote verses to supplement his
income². Between 41 B.c. the year after Philippi and 35
B.c. he composed the Epodes, and the first book of the
Satires. These poems would naturally be circulated indi·

< vidually by recitation or in copies as they were composed3

they did not appear as volumes till 34 Rc. Naturally also
Horace met the other young men of letters working at
Rome. Among them was virgil, who had taken part in the
civil war, but had been like Horace deprived of his estate ⁵·
Τὶιε property was restored to him by the influence of
Maecenas, one of Augustus’s two great ministers‚ whose
name has become proverbial for his patronage of literature.

Yet he is a poet without passion and a moralist without
originality. The other Latin poets who wrote of love
celebrate a single mistress; Catullus his Lesbia, Tibullus
his Delia, Propertius Cynthia, and Ovid his Corinna. If we
ask after Horace's lady-love, her name is Legion; Chloe,
Glycera, Leuconoe, Lyce and Cinara. All these ladies
are perfectly unrael to us. They may have existed, or the
poems in their honour may be simply translations from
the Greek. Lyce and Cinara are less shadowy than the rest,
and many people have written sentimentally οἱ Horace’s
devotion at least to the latter. But the most one can say
about her is that a few allusions prove her to have been the
least indefinite among the pleasant recollections of his youth.
She eost him nothing¹; not even the regret of seeing her
grow elderly and unattractive‚ for the Fates were kind and
cut her off in the fullness of her beauty ².

Not¹ only the most universal of passions‚ but those other
feelings which most strongly move mankind are curiously
lacking in Horace. Wifeless and childless‚ he is the club·
man among poets, leading a detached and sels-centred
γ existence. Yet to certain emotions his nature was finely
responsive. For Maecenas and for Virgil he had a friend-
ship of no common warmth : and, as befitted the intimate of
Augustus, he had a truly great sense of the greatness of Rome.
These two themes‚ friendship and patriotism‚ inspire what-
ever is best in the Odes, apart from the mere cbarm of
expression3 they alone rouse in him that enthusiasm which
gives him his claim to be in the highest sense of the word
a poet. In any real poetry there must always exist behind
the mere mastery of expression some vis vivida, some
animating energy. ’

But the thing which has given Horace his place is not
the matter but the formos his work. No great writer was
ever less original than Horace ; he is, indeed, in this typical

nori-25. 79

avenged the wrong done to Ajax, his half-brother. Teucer sailed
away to seek a new home and founded Salamis in Cyprus.

l. π. Lyaeo: Λυαῖος, the relaxa, is a Greek name for Dionysus.
Any of the names of a god may be used for the material thing
which he typifies-—so Bacchus isconstantly wine; tradere Vulcano is
a oemsffi, 5:15 ᾧ stupu-gn ἓ ῐΐὴξςοῐέἱιὶιίἰὲἑο the flames) Yonng verse-

1. ²5. quo . .. cunque: tmesis.

1. ²7· ⁸ When Teucer is your leder, and Teueex's star is your-s!
A general took the omens (auspicia) on behalf of his sollowers;
a campaign was conducted ductu et auspiciis eius. Soldiers in all

ages have believed in the luck or star of leudem, and at Rome the
belief was given a religions sanction.

l. 28. ‘ For Apollo who errs not, has promised that upon a new
soil there shall arise a Salamis to dispute the name? So Boston sor
instance is ambzkuus, there being two towns of the name, and the

μὲν town very much more famous than that from which it took
ι name.

l. 32. iterabimus: a very curious use. iterare aequor means
simply ‘to repeat the sea! But Horace here gives it the sense of ‘ to
travel again: partly misled no doubt by a false derivation from iter,
and partly by transference from iterare cursus.

CARMEN VIII.

’ This metre, the major sapphic, occurs nowhere else in Horace. The
ode is one οἱ those which probably had a Greek original.

l. 4. patiens pulveris atque solis. Three times in this
Horace uses single adjectiva like a Greek participle, to indicate
a qualisying sentence: cs. 5 and 12 militaris and nobilia The
qnalifying soree is shown by the following translation of ll. 4-6,
‘Why hates he the sunny plain. though strong to endnre both sun
and dust: why rides he not like a soldier among his males? nor
cnrbs with jagged bit the mouth of Gallie steeds3

lupatis, literally ‘wolfish.’

ll. 8-12. Why does he not bathe, wrestle, box or throw the
queit and javelin‘!

l. 8. olivum: the oil with which wrestlers anointed themselves.
· why does he avoid the wrestler's oil more warily than (he would
avoid) viper's blood ξ’ which was held to be a deadly poison. The
prose construction would have given the accusative with quam : cur
olivum vitat cautius quam avitat) sanguinem viperinum ,7

ll. 10-12. noque iam, &c., ‘ And uo longer has his arms dis·

coloured with the strain of spon, though famous sor often lannching
quoit or dart beyond the limit.'

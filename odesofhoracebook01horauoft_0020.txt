12 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Maecenas plays so large a part in the life of Horacegthat
it is necessary to give a sketch of his personality.

C. Cilnius Maecenas belonged to one of the noblest
families in Etruria ; and the Etruscan civilization which, as ·
the Romans believed, carne to Italy from a Lydian settlement,
was far older than the Roman. His descent was thus
illustrious; his forefathers on both sides of the house had
commanded armies 1; but his ancestors had never obtained
promotion at Rome, probably because it was against the
family tradition to seek it. At all events Maecenas never
took any official position; his status was merely that· os
an eques, a gentleman ², and any free-born Roman who
possessed 4oo,ooo sesterces (roughly Ᾰ4οοο) was entitled
to this rank, He was about Horace's equal in age; his
birthday fell on the Ides of April³; but nothing is known
of him till 40 Β. c., when he appears as a close friend and
confidant os Octavian, then triumvir. From this time
onward he was chief adviser in civil matters to the future
Emperor, as Agrippa was in military affairs. During the
campaign of 31 B.c. in which Antony was crushed at
Actium, Maecenas govemed Italy with full powers as regent.
His position was therefore unprecedented at Rome,
where power had hitherto been inseparable from office.
But Maecenas without ever entering the senate was by virtue
of his influence with the princeps a person far more to be
courted than the consuls themselves. He was fond of the
pleasant things of this life not less than of literature and
literary society. His house, if we can believe Horace, was
a centre sor the wits, and singularly free from corrupt

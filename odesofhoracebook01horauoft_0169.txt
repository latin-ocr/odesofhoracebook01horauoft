intrigue ¹. At all events, it is certain that Horace owed
his presentation to two other poets with whom he continued
in a friendship only broken by death, though he himself
attained to an intimacy with the patron which they could
scarcely claim, and received favours the like ot which were
not conferred on his introducers.

It was Virgil and Varins² who brought Horace to the
notice of Maecenas ; when, we cannot say, but it must have
been about 40 B.c. Horace describes his introduction, how
he blushed and stammered before the great man, who replied

after his custom briefly ³. N ine months later Maecenas
invited him to the house and told him to consider himself a
privileged visitor. In 37 Β. c. he accompanied Maecenas on
his journey to Brundisium, where the statesman went to
negotiate on behalf of Octavian with Antony's representa-
tives, Virgil and Varius being also of the party. The whole
journey is described in the fifth Satire of Book 1. The
intimacy grew and Horace received gists from his patron.

ln what year the famous Sabine sarm was bestowed upon him
we do not know 3 but throughout the first book of the Satires,
’ that is up to 35 B.c.‚ he writes as a townsman. In the second
book (35—30 Β. C.) he speaks constantly of his country retreat;
and about the same period begin those allusions to his own
indolence which grow increasingly frequent ⁴. Of the Odes
the first three books were published in 24 B.c. ; several

68 THE ool-:s OF HORACE.

ll. 1-3. The order is Ille, quicunque primum (te posuit), et
nefasto die te posuit et sacrilega manu (te) produxit.

Translate: ‘ Unlucky was the day of your setting, whoever set you
first, and sacrilegious was the hand that trained you up, O trec, to
the ruin of posterity and the district’s disgrace.’

1. 1. nefasto : the opposite of fastus, a day on which legal busi-
ness might be done. But in common speech nefastus was used in
reference only to those days on which the courts did not sit, because

some evil omen prevented thern. In poetry the word is scarcely
different from nefarius or nefandus.

· 1. 2. sacrilega: for it is an impiety of the tree to threaten its
innocent master.

11. 5, 4. in . . . perniciem: cs. datae in praesidium cohortes, Tac.
H. iv. 35, and C. iv. 2. 55, where Horace speaks of the calf which
‘largis iuvenescit herbis In mea vota,’ i. e. to pay my VOWS.

l. 5. Illum . . . crediderim. Translate: ‘That hand, I could
believe,’ &c. Wickham compares S. i. 5. 44 ‘Nil ego contulerim
iucundo sanus amico.'

1. 6. penetralia: his secret chambers.

1. 7. nocturno cruore, ‘with bloodshed by night?

1. 8. Hospitis here is ‘ guest.'

11. 8-10. Ille: note the emphatic repetition. Translate again
‘that hand.’ The order is Ille tractant venena Colcha et
quidquid nefas usquam concipitur. ‘ That hand dealt ifl Colchian

drugs and whatever iniquity is anywhere imagined.'
Colchis, the birthplace of Medea, had a traditional same sor

wite-hes and poisoners. So Epod. 5. 24, and especially 17. 35
‘Cales venenis officina Colchicis.‘
1. 11. triste, ‘baleful ' ; caducum, ‘ destined to fall?

ll. 13, 14. Quid quisque vitet, nunquam homini satis Cautum
est in horas. The sense is perfectly plain. ⁴ M ankind is never suffi-
ciently awake from hour to hour to the dangers which each should

shun.‘ in horas, like in dies, ‘ hourly.’

homini nunquam satis Cautum est, = hanzines nunquam satis
cavent. The difficulty lies in the dependent question : Quid quia-
que vitet. But cave quid vites, ‘ watch what you have to shun‚’
though not usual, would be intelligible Latin. Cf. the similar
elliptie use osan interrogative in C. i. 33. 2 neu . . . Decantes elegos,
cur tibi iunior Laesa praeniteat fide.

11. 14, 15. navita . . . Poenus: a purely literary epithet, chosen
not sor the sense, but to give colour to the verse. Any sailor would
be as likely as a Carthaginian to count the Bosporus his chief peril.

11. 1 5, 16. ‘And once beyond that, does not sear the fates that lurk
elsewhere‚' lit. ‘ the unseen sates from elsewhere?

l. 16. Caeca . . . fata, ‘ vicwless ’ ς so caeco carpitur igni, Virg. Aen.

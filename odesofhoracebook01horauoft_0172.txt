16 THE ODES OF HORACE.

the poet of those who do not care for poetry. He has really
more affinity with an essayist like Montaigne, or even with
a writer of maxims like La Rochefoucauld, than with Homer,
Virgil, Dante, Shakspeare, Shelley and Tennyson ; a full half
of his work, the Satires an'd Epistles, is not poetry at all, as he
knew and said himself ¹. The Satires have not even the
charm of harmonious verse which belongs for instance to Pope’s
Moral Essays. But whether they are poetry or not, they are
admirable literature, and more than any other document of
antiquity they make Rome of that day real to us. 'l he Epodes,
hisearliest work in lyrical forms, are with one or two exceptions
of comparatively little interest ; many os them are coarse and
bitter personal attacks. The odes, upon which Horace rests
his claim to be a poet and not merely a good writer, occupy
a position that is unique in literature. They are undoubtedly
the best—known poetry in the world. If every copy of them
were destroyed to—morrow, it would be easy to form for
instance a committee of the House of Commons, which could
restore from memory the entire text within a week. They
have been drilled and flogged into numberless generations of
schooIboys, and yet they have not lost their charm. Byron
certainly was of a different opinion. ‘Then.farewe11, Horace,’
he writes :-

Then farewell, Horace: whom Ι hated so,
Not sor your saults, but mine;· it is a curse
To understand. not feel, your lyric flow,
To compoehend, but never love, your verse.

But nearly all teachers will agree that Horace is the one
poet who keeps his freshness in the wear and tear of the
class-mom. 1t is worth while trying to analyse his singular

charm.
Horace appeals to mankind as a poet and a moralist.

¹ His, ego quae nunc,
Olim quae scripsit Lucilius, eripias si
Tempora certa modosque, et, quod prius ordine verbum est,
Posterius facias, praeponens ultima primis,
Non, ut si solvas ‘ Postquam Discordia tetra
Belli ferratos postes portasque refregit‚'
Invenias etiam disiecti membra poetae—S. i. 4. 56.

90 THE ODES OF HORACE

Bridge almost let the enemy across —had it not been for
a single man, Horatius.')
Nec veni, nisi sata locum sedemque dedissent.
Virg. Aen. xi. 112.
‘Nor came I there—had not the fates assigned
My seat and habitation.'

These are deliberate departures from grammar with a
rhetorical purpose, like Shakespeare’s-—

‘An 1 might live to see thee married once,
I lzave my wish.'— Romeo and Juliet.

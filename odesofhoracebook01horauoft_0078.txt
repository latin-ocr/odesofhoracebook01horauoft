70 THE ODES OF HORACE.

in stanzas of four lines each—a method which pervades the 0110ss
Nauck, however, begins the ode with ‘ Sunt quos ' and ends at
‘ barbiton‚‘ thus making eight four-line stanzas. This he thinks was
the original ode, having no relation to Maecenas: Horace later tacked
on the first two and last two lines. Perhaps the train of thought is:
My delight it is to write poems, which, if the Muses do not check my
inspiration‚ is a delight fit for gods; but if you give me an
acknowledged place among the poetS, my delight will increase till
Ι ‘ strike the stars with my uplisted head.'

Wickham well points out the change of tone in such a poem
ἒῗεῖγϊίὶὲίε 30, where Horace claims immortality as already won by ἱ

CARMEN II.

The object of the ode is to pay a superb compliment to Augustus.
Its drist is as follows. Portents show that Jove is wrath with Rome
(1-20). We suffer sor our saults (21-24). What god can Rome
invoke for aid? Apollo, Venus, Mars? or—if indeed it be Mercmy,
(the luck-bringer) who dwells among us in the likeness of a youth—
then let him not be incensed with our vices, and let Caesar tarry till

he completes his work.
The skill should be noted with which Horace avoids formally

declaring that Caesar is a god; it is a more delicate flattery to say
it by implication.

The portents referred to are probably those noted aster Caesar’s
death. The inundation certainly took place in 44 B. C.

1. 5. gentes, ‘ mankind.’ ‘Jove scared mankind with the sear lest
the dread age should return of Pyrrha, who bewailed strange prodigies
in the day when Proteus drove his flocks to visit the mountains!

Note that this version gives the force of questae (perf. pt.) and
emphasizes the temporal use of cum. Visere is the Infin. expressing
purpose after a verb of motion, a construction imitated from the
Greek which is common in Latin poetry, but inadmissible in Latin

Ρῐῗῗὲ. Pyrrha was the wife of Deucalion, and these two human beings

alone survived the Deluge, which figured in the Hellenic as in most

other mythologies.
l. 7. Proteus, the sea G0d3 his flock were seals. Cp. Georg. iv.

425 sqq·

1. 14. The litus Etruscum is the North bank of Tiber. The river
makes a sharp bend, and the high Etruscan shore ‘ flung the water
back violently ’ flooding the city.

l. 15. monumenta regis, the old palace of Numa which stood
near Vesta’s temple. Que sometimes couples two designations of the
same thing: ‘ even ' ε cf. ‘ Titanas immanemque turmam,’ iii. 4. 43.

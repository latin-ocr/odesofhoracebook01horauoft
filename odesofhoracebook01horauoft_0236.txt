80 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ll. 23, 24 Quid quod . . . revellis = Quid (dicam de hoc)
quod revellis 3 ‘ What shall Ι say of that ’Β ’

Translate: ‘Ay, more than this, you pluck up continually the
neighbouring boundary marks of your estate and overleap the marks
of your own dependants in your greed.’

1. 23. usque, in absolute use, ‘ incessantly.’ Cf.

‘an us ue
In nostrum iacies verba superba cacflmtJ—Prop. ii. 8. 15.

l. 24. terminos: cf. Dent. xxvli. 17 ‘Cursed be he that removeth
his neighbour's landmark.’

l. 2 5. clientium: the fraud, bad enough anyhow, was worse when
practised on a cliens whom it was his duty to protect. They ranked
next to parents; so Virg. Aen. vi. 609 ‘ Pulsatusve patens, et fraus
innexa clienti.’

11. 26-28. The construction is: Et uxor pellitur et vir (pellitur)
ferens in sinu paternos Deos sordidosque natos.

11. 26-28. paternos: they are evicted from homes where their
fathers dwelt ; sordidos: they are still poor.

l. 27. ferens Deos : the images of the Lares.

l. 29. Here the thought returns tol. 19, struis domos. ‘Build
mansione as you will, enlarge your bounds, the mansion most surely
in store is the abode of death.'

certior is a predicate.

11. 29-32. Translate: ‘Yet no mansion awaits the rich master with
more certainty than the end appointed for him in devouring Orcus!

There are many ways of taking these lines ε

1. (as given) Nulla aula manet divitem herum certior desti-
nata fine rapacis Orci, where fine is abl. of comparison.

2. Nulla aula manet divitem herum certior (aula destinata)
fine rapacis Orci, where fine is instrumental abl.‚ and destinata
agrees wilh stulti understood = ‘more certain than the mansion
marked out sor him by the limit of greedy Oreus ⁷ (cf. τέλος θανάτοιο),
so Wickham.

3. Nulla destinata aula manet divitem herum, certior fine
rapacis Orci. ¹ No house that he has planned awaits the rich man

more certainly than the end of greedy Oreus.’
The metre seems to indicate that fine destinata should go

to ether.
ξ. 32. Quid ultra tendis? ‘ why aspire beyond 3 ‘
ultra: sc. finem Orci.
l. 33. recluditur, ‘is trenched.'

1. 34. regumque pueris: the only place in the ode where Horace
resolves the iambic into a tribraeh.

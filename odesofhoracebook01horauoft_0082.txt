74 THE ODES OF HORACE.

1. 32. The accent of the verse seems to show that priua must go ¹
with semoti3 ‘ And slow Fate hastened the step of Death before
remote.’ Some, however, take necessitas leti together, ‘ and the once
slow inevitableness of distant death quickened its pace.'

1. 34. Daedalus, the famous axtificer, whom Minos imprisoned
ffagzegte, till he escaped with his son Icarus on wings of his own
1. 36. Hercules went down into Hades to deliver Theseus. In

perrupit the last syllable is lengthened, though short by nature.
The stress of the foot falls on it ; it is the syllaba in arsi.

l. 38. petimus, ‘we assaiL’

l. 40. iracunda . .. fulmina, ‘ thunderbolts of wrath ' : iracundus,
in prose could hardly be applied to a thing. But cf. ¹5. 33
‘ iracunda . . . classis Achillei) Probably Horace had here before
his mind an expression of Pindar's in Nem. vi. 55, when he tells
how Achilles slew Memnon ἀκμᾷ ἔγχεος ζακότοιο, ‘ with the point os
the wrathsul sword.’

CARMEN IV.

This ode belongs to Horace’s period of metrical experimentation
and its metre occurs only here. The composition is no better than
a poetical exercise on a stoek theme. Man‘s life changes like the
seasons; therefore make the most os youth.

Sestius, to whom it is addressed, served like Horace under M. Brutus
in Macedonia, and like him also was reconciled to Augustus.

l. 2. The Latins and Greeks hardly put to sea in winter at all, but

the approach of spring.

l. 5. imminente Luna, simply ⁴ under the moon.'

1. 10. solutae, thawed, ‘ loosened)

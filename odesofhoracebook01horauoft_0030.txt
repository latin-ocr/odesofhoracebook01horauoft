22 THE ODES OF HORACE.

sar East : once more the ode concludes with a reference to
the Massagetae (who stand for the Parthians) still needing‘
conquest: Ode 37 is the triumph song over Cleopatra's fall
in 30 B.c. 3 the cry of deliverance from long impending peril.
This utterance of course must be five years earlier than Ode
29, which refers to the expedition to Arabia, dispatched
m 24 B.c.

The envoy or concluding poem is also light in tone, in strong
contrast with those attached to the second and third books, in
each of which the poet predicts for himself world-wide fame
and immortality.

The following is a table of the metres used in this book.
Every student should know at least how to scan the Alcaic,
Sapphic, and Asclepiad verses. The caesura is marked thus ΙΙ.

1. Alcmam’an. C. 7, 28.

Te maris Ι et terr Ι ae ΙΙ numer Ι oque car Ι entis ar Ι enae Ι
Mensor Ι em cohib Ι ent Arch Ι yta—

The first line is an ordinary hexameter: the second a
dactylic tetrameter=four feet, scanned like the last four of
a hexameter.

2. First Asclepiad. C. 1.

-Ξ -υυ-ΙΙ-υυ-ΙυΞ

Maecen Ι as atavis ΙΙ edite reg Ι ibus-

This verse is called the Asclepiadeus minor. The foot
-υυ- is a choriambus.

3. Second Asclepiad 3 versus asclepiadeus major. C. 11. 18.

Δ--Ι-ψυ-ΙΙ--ψψ-·Ι-υψ--ΙψῬ-λ·

Tu ne Ι quaesieris, Ι scire nefaS, ΙΙ quem mihi, quem [tibi
4. T hirci Asclepi'ad. C. 3, 13, 19, 36.

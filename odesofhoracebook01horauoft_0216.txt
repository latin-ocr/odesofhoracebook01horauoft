60 THE ODES OF HORACE.

. li 21. The Massic wine, ‘ which brings forgetfulness‚’ was a strong
vin a e.

leffia, ‘ polished.'

1. 22. Ciboria, ‘ beakers,’ from the Greek κιβώριον, shaped like
the pod of the Egyptian bean (κιβωρία).

The anacrusis is short, see on ι. 6 supr.

ll. 23-25. Quis udo, &c. ‘ Ho, there! whose task is it to twine
at a moment's notice garlands of dew-sprent parsley or of myrtle3'
We might almost render deproperare ‘ to improvise.’ Cf. for the
form of command infr. 11. 18.

1. ²5· Curatve myrto: the suffix -ve is displaced3 prose would
require myrtove, which is the alternative.

ll. 2 5, 26. ‘ Whom will Venus name for master of the revels 1 ’

The arbiter bibendi was chosen from among the company at
a dinner by casting the dice. His function was to decide the pro·
afflige? wine to water in the crater or mixing-bowl, and to call

Venus was the name given to the highest throw with the dioe, as
the lowest was called canis. Cf. Prop. iv. 8. 46;

‘ Me quoque per talos Venerem quaerente secundos,
Semper damnosi subsiluere canes.'

The highest throw with the tali (four-sided dice) was 1, 2, 3, 4
(four being used). With the tesserae (cubes) it was three sixes.

11. 27, 28. ‘ Ι will revel it as madly as the Thraeians: it is delight-
ful to bid good-bye to reason when Ι welcome a friend home.’

The Edoni were a tribe in Thrace, and all Thracians were notorious
drinkers. For the last line, cf. C. iv. 12. 28 ‘Dulce est desipere in

loco!

CARMEN VIII.

One of the best of Horace's lighter odes. Nothing could exceed
the selicity of the phrasing.

1. 1. ‘Is any penalty for the oaths you forswore.’ Peierare or
periurare is in prose only used absolutely, without a case. Ius
{ZZZZ'Z is here a poetical expression formed on the analogy of ius

1. 5. ‘ 1 should have saith! ‘ 1 were a believer-which I am not!
The form of the conditional sentence, being constructed of historic
tenses of the subjunctive, implies, of course, that no penalty has

reached Barine; therefore Horace turns infidel. Why have saith ⁷

when the heavens reward per-jury ?

11. 5-8. ‘ But you, when you have bound by oaths that perfidious
head, shine out m’ore fair by far, and walk abroad the cynosure of

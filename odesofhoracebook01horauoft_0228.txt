foro lwnpeius, Cic. Mil. vii. 18.

ll. 15, 16. Rome was and is unhealthy in autumn, at the season
of the Seirocco. Cf. S. ii. 6. 19:

‘ plumbeus Auster,
Autumnusque grav1s, Libitinae quaestus acerbae.'

1. 16. Corporibus metuemus Austrum: metuo may be used
either with the simple dative, ‘ to be apprehensive sor' (so metuens
formica senectae, Virg. Geo. i. 186) or with acc. of the thing feared.

1. 17. visendus (supply est): so with linquenda, infr. 21.

H ypermnestra, slew their husbands in one night. They were doomed

to draw water sor ever in urns with a pierced bottom. See C. iii. <
11. 22 sqq.

11. 19, 20. Damnatus longi . . . laboris. Damnare governs an acc.
of the person, a genitive of the charge or penalty. So damnatus
venefici, ‘condemned on a charge of poisoning ’; damnatus capitale,
‘ condemned to lose the caput or civic existence ’; damnatus octupli,
‘ condemned to pay eight times the amount’ in question. The abl.
is also found in both senses, e. g. capite. Of these constructions,
the ablative should be related to the abl. of price, the genitive to
the gen. aster verbs of estimating.

potiore quam id qnod pontificum cenis bibitur. This condensa-
tion is called brachylogy of comparison z so κόμαι Χαρίτεσσιν ὁμοῖαι

pontisss' banquets.’ The wine is, as it were, personified.

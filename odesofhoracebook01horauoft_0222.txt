ll. 8, 9. domus Saturni veteris was the dwelling of the gods on
Olympus. Satum‚ the {ather of Zeus, and chief of the older race of

1. 11. melius: take with dices: ‘better than 1.’

11. 11, 12. ductaque per vias regum colla minacium: refers to
the Roman custom of parading fettered captives through the streets

l. 18. dare brachia: 1 take this closely with nitidis virginibus:

84 THE oDEs OF HORACE.

ll. 6, 7. quern vocas ‘dilecte,’ ‘whom thou callest “ dear’'·’=
an alternative rendering is ⁴ I, dear Maecenas, whom you summon to
you' ε supplying ad te with vocas. But vocare in this sense means,
it would seem, only ‘ to ask to dinner'; and in any case this sense
would rob the passage of its point and dignity. ’

11. 9-12 describe the metamorphosis in Horace.

l. 9. iam iam, ⁴ already!

head and shoulders.

leves ε note quantity.

l. ¹3· Daedaleo Ι ocior Icaro. Note the hiatus, which is defen-
sible as occurring at the pause which separates the trochaic part of
the verse from the dactyliC. Some editors, following certain MSS.‚
read notior (more famous). Daedalus, the famous artificer, was
imprisoned in Crete by Minos, but made wings sor himself and sor
his son Icarus with which they flew away. Icarus soared too near
to the sun, the wax fastenings melted, he fell, and was drowned in

1. 17. The ode turns to a more serious prophecy of his universal
same. With this should be compared his less sanguine anticipations
in the envoy to Epp. i. (Ep. 20), where he tells his book that after
its first bloom is off in Rome, it will cross the seas to Africa or
Spain; or for a final ignominy, ‘spend a mumbling old age in
teaehing boys their rudiments.’ Each prophecy has been fulfiued
to the uttermost.

lived on the eastern shore of the Black Sea.

qui dissimulat metum: who really fears, but makes show of

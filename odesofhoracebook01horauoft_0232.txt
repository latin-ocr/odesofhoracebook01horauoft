76 THE ODES OF HORACE.

tollit hinnitum. The last syllable elides before the vowel in
ἒαῑὲῐὲα. J'l'his continuity of metre is called synaphcia. Cf. Carm.
⁵ 4 ι ‘Romulae genti date remque prolemque
Et decus omne.’

ll. 35, 36. bis Afro murice tinctae. Bis, twice dyed stuffs would
be richer in colour. Afro : the Murex, or purple fish, was found in
the Levant and the dye invented at Tyre. The Carthaginians were
emigrants from Tyre aud no doubt took the industry with them.

ll. 37, sqq. mihi parva rura, &c., ‘To me an honest-dealing
F ate gave my small farm, the subtle spirit of the Grecian Muse, and
contempt for the malignant rabble.’

l. 38. Graiae . . . Camenae: Camenae were the Latin Muses.
Horace perhaps implies that he writes in Latin poems of Greek form.

l. 39. malignum, ‘ envious of his success?

CARMEN XVII.

On Maecenas, see Introduction, p. 12.

Compare with this ode, supr. C. 13, C. iii. 8, andC. i. 20.

C. i. 20 refers merely to Maecenas's reception in the theatre on his
reeovery from illness. Horace, to commemorate this event, laid
down some wine grown on the Sabine farm which Maecenas gave
him, and this wine he invites his patron to drink. ⁴

C. 13 os this book mentions the escape from the falling tree, but
says nothing of Maecenas.

C. iii. 8 is another invitation to Maecenas for March 1, the
anniversary of Horace's escape: but this makes no mention of the
incident in the theatre. In the present ode, lines 21 sqq. seem to
couple the two events, and some have concluded that they occurred
on at least the same day of the year though in different years. But
if so, it is extraordinary that Horace should not note the coincidence
in one or other of the two invitations.

An expert in astrology tells me that there is nothing in the passage
to point to a similarity of dates. Horace merely says: ‘ Our horo—
scopes have a strange resemblance, that is, the astrological signs at
your birth hour and at mine foreshowed a similarity os sate.’ In
support of this he alleges that each has had a narrow escape3
though Maecenas was saved by the benefic aspect of Jupiter,
Horace by the protection of Mercury.

The occasion of the ode is plainly a letter from Maecenas, or
a talk with him, in which Maecenas had expressed apprehensions
of his own death.

1. 1. exanimas, ‘ do you kill'me)

l. 2. prius : sc. quam me. ‘ It is not heaven's will, no, nor mine,
that you should be first to depart.'

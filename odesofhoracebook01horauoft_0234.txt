78 THE omas or HORACE.

populace thrice in ‘the theatre clapped their joyful welcome to thee.
Of me, a tree-trunk‚ fallen on my head, had made an end, if Faunus
had not with his right hand withheld the stroke, being the guardian
οξ the men whom Mercury protects. Be mindsul, you, to pay the
vrcttms·andlthebshr1ne you vowed ; as for me, I w1ll slay an un-
pretentlous am .’

tl. 21.. incredibili modo: there is a false caesura at the prepo-
ει ion zn-.
l. 22. impio: Satum was always a baleful star; he was also

z'rltlzzgus because he had the unnatural habit of devouring his own
c 1 ren.

ll. 27-29. Me truncus . . . sustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum . . .
levasset. See Appendix ΙΙΙ on the grammar of this.

1. ²9· Mercurialium. Horace was under the protection of
Mercury who invented the lyre; Mercury being in the ascendant
at his birth helped to make him a lyric poet, and, as the god of
luck, gave him his lucky escape. But it seems pretty clear that
Horace is using astrological terms in a very loose fashion, and
confounds astrology with myth. Faunus, the god of country places,
is the agent of his rescue, apparently because Faunus is identified
with Pan, and Pan is the child of Mercury.

A man born under the influence of Mercury might also become
a merchant lucky in buying and selling. Cf. S. ii. 3. 25 of
Damasippus, the connoisseur:

‘ Unde frequentia Mercuriali '
Imposuere mihi cognomen compita.’

C ARMEN XVIII.

Horace eulogizes the moderation of his own desires, and contrasts
it with the unreasoning avarice of a rich man whom he addresses as
‘ you.' The ode has a terseness and sting in its phrasing rare even
in Horace.

l. 2. lacunar: a panelled ceiling; the gilding would be on the
parts in relief.

ll 3, 4. trabes are the cross pieces. the architrave resting on the
columns. Premunt, ‘lean on.' The point is, of course, in the
luxury which, not content with mere marble colonnades‚ must have
marble from Mount Hymettus in Attica, and from furthest Africa.

11. 5, 6. Attali. Attalus Philometor, King of Pergamus died in
133 B. c. and lest his property to the Romans, excluding his rightful
heir Aristonicus. Thus the ‘ heir of Attalus ' was a proverb for one
who came into wealth unexpected and undeserved. Cf. Attalicis
conditionibus, C. i. 1. 12.

1. 8. Trahunt, ‘ spin' : cf. Juv. ii. 54 ‘ Vos lanam trahitis.'
honestae, emphatie; they are not slaves, ‘honourable ladies in
my servrce.

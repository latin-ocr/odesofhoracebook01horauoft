64 THE omis OF HoRAcE.

CARMEN XI.

To Hirpinus—of whom nothing is known.

11. 1-5. The principal verb is remittas, a jussive subjunctive, less
abrupt than the imperative ε ⁶ You should desist! The construction
is remittas quaerere, Quinti Hirpine, quid Cantaber et
scythes cogitet.. cogitet is for the sake of metre attracted into
the number of the nearest subject. It is of course subjunctive, as the
verb in an indirect question. The Cantabrians (cs. supr. 6. 2) were
Spaniards, the Scythians occupied chiefly what is now Seuthem
Russia.

ll. 3, 4. remittas Quaerere: so mitte sectari, C. i. 38. 3.

l. 4. nec trepides. T repides being also jussive subjunctive has
something os the optative construction, and may therefore take
nec instead of neu: as utinam mm facias is equally admissible
with utinam ne facias. T repidare means ‘to bustle‚’ cf. supr.
3. 12. So here ‘ to be in a flutter‚‘ ‘to be anxious! Cf. C. iii. 29. 31
‘ Ridetque‚ si mortalis ultra Fas trepidat!

Translate the passage: ‘ Cease to enquioe into the warlike
Spaniards‘ planS, Quintius Hirpinus, or the Scythians'‚ since he is
divided from us by the Adriatic’s barrier, and fret not yourself sor
the needs of a lise that craves so little-⁹

in usum. In with the accusative means osten ‘for,’ implying
destination: so commeatus in annum ; in hiemem comparare sru-
menta. -

1. 6. Levis, ‘smooth,' so ‘beardless‚’ λεῖοςε cf. C. iv. 6. 28 ‘Levis
Agyieu?

arida, ‘ sapless,’ ‘ withered.‘

l. 9. honor, ‘glory.’

ll. 10, 1 1. uno . . . Vultu, ‘with a constant countenance?

11. 1 1, 1 2. ‘ Why jade your spirit too weak for never-ending policyi’

1. 1 1. minorem: i. e. imparem. Wickham says aeternis consiliis
means ‘ plans sor a life that is not to end?

1. 14. temere: εἰκῆ, ‘with no preparation.' Horace suggests an
immediate relaxation.

11. 14, 15. rosa canos odorati capillos, would be in prose‘ canis
capillis rosa odoratis) Poets constantly use the nominative of the

participle with an accusative os respect to avoid the recnrrence of so
many similar terminations as the ablative absolute involves; cf·

infr. 2 .
l. lg. Dum lieet, ‘while age allows!
1. 17. Euius: Bacchus, called Εὔιος from the cry Εὗοῖ Βάκχε. .

11. 18-20. ‘ Ho, there! what slave will allay this draught of hot
Falernian with the spring that runs beside us?’

12 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Maecenas plays so large a part in the life of Horace that
it is necessary to give a sketch of his personality.

C. Cilnius Maecenas belonged to one of the noblest
families in Etruria; and the Etruscan civilization which, as
the Romans believed, came to Italy from a Lydian settlernent‚
was far older than the Roman. His descent was thus
illustrious; his foresathers on both sides of the house had
commanded armies '; but his ancestors had never obtained
promotion at Rome, probably because it was against the
family tradition to seek it. At all events Maecenas never
took any official positi0n; his status was merely that of
an eques, a gentleman ², and any free-born Roman who
possessed 400,000 sesterces (roughly A4000) was entitled

to this rank. He was about Horace’s equal in age3 his >

birthday fell on the Ides of Apri1³; but nothing is known
of him tin 40 B.c., when he appears as a close friend and
confidant of Octavian, then triumvir. From this time
onward he was chief adviser in civil matters to the future
Emperor, as Agrippa was in military affairs. During the
campaign of 31 B.C. in which Antony was crushed at
Actium, Maecenas governed Italy with full powers as regent.
His position was therefore unprecedented at Rome,
where power had hitherto been inseparable from office.
But Maecenas without ever entering the senate was by virtue
os his influence with the princeps a person far more to be
courted than the consuls themselves. He was fond of the
pleasant things of this life not less than of literature and
literary society. His house, if we can believe Horace, was
a centre sor the wits, and singularly free from corrupt

102 THE ODES OF HORACE.

l. 17. peccas: a mild word: the line almost means ‘your pec·>
cadillo does you no discredit.'

quidquid habes, ‘ whatever you have to tell.'

1. 18. The youth is supposed to whisper a name to Horace, and
Horace stan-ts away. ‘Poor soul, what a Charybdis had you been
struggling in, you who deserved a luckier flame.' Charybdis was the
famous whirlpool in the Sicilian Straits.

laborabas: note the graphio use of the imperfect, ‘ were you
struggling all this time.’ Cp. tempus erat, 37. 4. Laborare is used
specially of a ship in distress.

l. 21. Thessalis . . . venenis, by the drugs of Thessaly. Thessalian
wizards were famous: cf. Epod. 5. 45:

‘Quae sidera excantata voce Thessala
Lunamque caelo deripit ’ ;—-also Ep. ii. 2. ²09·

l. 2 3. ‘ Scarcely will Pegasus himself free you, thus entangled, from
the three-shaped Chimaera.' Pegasus was the winged horse upon
which Bellerophon rode to encounter Chimaera, a monster whose
forepart was lion, whose hind part was dragon, and whose middle
was goat: hence trzsormzk.

CARMEN XXVIII.

There has been much controversy as to the meaning and structure
of this ode, which may be roughly analyzed to show the points in
dispute. It must be premised that if a corpse did not receive at least
formal burial, that is three handfuls of dust thrown on it, the spirit
was not permitted to cross the Styx, but must wander on earth for
a hundred years around the body.

You, Archytas, are detained by the Matine shore for the lack of
a little dust, great man of science though you were. Pelops too
died and Tithonus and Minos though the friends of Gods; and
Empedocles is dead, though he declared that only his body perished
——he who in your judgement was no mean judge of nature and truth.
All must die; there are many ways of death, but no man escapes. Itoo
perished by drowning in the Adriatic. But you, ο sailor, do not fail
to give me burial. If you give it, you shall have my blessing ; if not,
my curse. It will not delay you, only three handfuls of dust to throw.

According to some, the ode is a dialogue between the sailor who
speaks ll. 1-6 and the Ghost os Archytas. But it is ridiculous to
suppose that Archytas would appeal to the sailor sor a judgement
(1. 14). It is better therefore to make it a dramatic monologue.
Horace, sailing in the Adriatic and coasting the shore, as was usual,
may have seen a drowned and unburied body, and perhaps gone
ashore to bury it. The reflections which the scene suggested he
would put as an appeal for burial‚ supposed to be uttered by the
ghost which would haunt the place if the body were left unburied.

ODE XXXIV.

Parcus deorum cultor.

‘1 that have seldom worshipped heaven,
As to a mad sect too much given,
My former ways am forced to balk
And after the old light to walk.
For cloud-dividing lightening Jove
Through a clear firmament late drove
His thundering horses and swift wheels,
With which supporting Atlas reels,
With which Earth‚ Seas, the Stygi an lake,
And Hell with all her fi'res did quake.
It shook me too. God pulls the proud
From his high seat, and imm their cloud
Draws the obscure; levels the hills,
And with their earth the valley fills.
’Tis he does all, he does it all:
Yet this blind mortals Fortune can:

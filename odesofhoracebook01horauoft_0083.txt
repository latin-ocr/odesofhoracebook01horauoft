goeswith pulsnt: itm with the soot not thehnnd that thedoor
wumck whm admittanoe was sought. Cp. Ar. Rau. 38 ὡς κενταυ-
ρικῶς ἐνήλατο. Even more decisive are πὶ θύρετρα καλῷ ποδὶ Φοῖβος

ἀμύσσει, Callim. Ap. 3, and ⁸ pulsando pedibus paene confregi hasce

l. 16. im, ‘presentlyl premet, ‘ will weigh upon you?

mulne: 'Persius an imitator of Horace, writes (5. 152) ‘cinis
et manes et fabula fies: Fabula means a legend—so ‘the shades,
those mythic beingsl, It is nom. in apposition to Manes.

l. 17. exilia, ‘lean’z temes, ‘bodiloes’ is the epithet constantly
applied to umbrae. Horace slightl varies it. He has, 110 doubt,
in his mind Homer's νεκύων Apeva-«lma. Similar is the mean-
ing of lem} turba (i. 10. 18). Cioero in one os his letters applies
the adj. nilis to a ‘ skeletou legion: 0110 that was greatly below

when each of the four tali showed a different number. Canis was the
lowest. Cp. Prop. iv. 8, 45 :

‘Me quoque per iactus Venerem quaerente secundam
Semper damnosi subsiluere (mnes.²

The arbiter bibendas arranged toasts, and fixed the proportiou of
wine to water in the crater.

CARM EN V.

This ode is among the most famous for its eharm os phrasing.
Milton made a much overrated translation of it.

l. 1. in rosa. Either (1) ‘crowned with roses' (as in Cic. Fin. ii.
g} guse. v. 26), or (2) ‘ on a bed of roses.’ Multa seems in favour

l. 4. eui? ‘sor whom?¹ ‘to please whom?

1. 5. simplex munditiis, ‘Simple in your eleganoe.' Horace is
far from meaning that Pyrrha dressed inexpensively. He means

that she dressed fasfflouably, but in the perfeetion of good taste.
The words mn hardly be adequately rendered.

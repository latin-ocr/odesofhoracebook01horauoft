babina=h5m ¹. The same disgrace had besallen Almeus,
a more-warmic poet; but it is unreasonable to suppose
that Horace was a toward. A youth of three and twenty,
without persona] interest, and destitute os miLitary knowledge
would not have been put into so responsible a position
unless he had a reputation at least sor bravery. Horace writes
pleasantly of'his disaster, and cowards do not dwell on their
own discomfiture- He did not, however, ‘drist back into
the tide of war,’ like his friend Pompeius Varus (to
whom the poem quoted below is addressed), but returned
to Italy ‘with his wings clippedl His estate had been
confiscated by the victors‚ and for some years he lived
a life of struggling poverty ². He had enough money to
purchase a place as scr. ba or public clerk in the treasury³3
and in later lise this guild of public servants used to consult
him on matters of importance ¹. But poverty gave hardi-
hood, as he says, and he wrote verses to supplement this
income ². Between 41 B.c. the year after Philippi and 35
Rc. he composed the Epodes, and the first book of the
Satires. These poems would naturally be circulated indi-
vidually by recitation or in copies as they were composed3
they did not appear as volumes till 34 B.c. N aturally also
Horaoe' met the other young men os letters working at
Rome. Among them was Virgil, who had taken part in the
civil war, but had been like Horace deprived of his estate ⁵-
Τὴε property was restored to him by the influence of
Maecenas, one of Augustus's two great ministers, whose
name has become proverbial sor his patronage of literature.

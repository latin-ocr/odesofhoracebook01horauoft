18 THE oDEs OF HORACE.

of the whole Latin literature, which subsisted on borrowings.
Of his Odes it is pretty certain that many were mere trans-
lations from the Greek. Even in his Satires, the only
distinctively Latin form of composition, he admits that
he followed Lucilius; and Professor Tyrrell goes so far
as to say, on the strength of certain fragments os the older
poet which survive, that he merely modernized the poems
as Dryden and Pope modernized Chaucer. But Dryden

and Pope only superseded Chaucer for a ffiw years, whereas
Horace entirely replaced Lucilius : and it must be admitted

in common fairness that the best thing in the Satires, his
account of his relations with Maecenas and the envy it
brought upon him in his every-day life, and the best things
in the Odes, like his magnificent song of triumph over the
defeat of Cleopatra, cannot possibly have been imitations.
And many famous passages in his lyrics‚ which, having no
particular reference, may possibly be translations, would
probably be equally famous, even if an original existed.

Though old the thought and oft expressed,
'Tis his at last who says it best.

And Horace possesses a great deal of inalienable estate
acquired in this title. It was the study of his life ‘proprie
communia dicere,’ to express moral truths or even truisms
in such a way as to stamp them his own sor ever. The
method has its disadvantages. You may turn over Horace
from cover to cover without meeting a thought which might
not have occurred to any one; there are platitudes on almost
every page3 and the obscurity‚ which results from attempt
at condensafion, is, as he very well knew, his commonest
fault ¹. Yet, in writing of this sort, it is the hits which count,
not the misses ; and Horace has become, what he would have
certainly chosen to be, the most quotable and most quoted
of writers. He is so communis, so impersonal, that every-
body can sympathize with his utterance. His standpoint
is almost everywhere the balanced attitude of middle age.

APPENDIX Ι.

TRANSLATION OF ODE V111. To BARINE.
Ulla si iuris.

Did any punishment attend
Thy former perjuries‚
1 should believe, a second time,
Thy charming flatteries:
Did but one wrinkle mark thy face
Or hadst thou lost one single grace.

No sooner hast thou, with false vows,
Provoked the powers above,
But thou art fairer than before,
And we are more in love.
Thus Heaven and Earth seem to declare
They pardon falsehood in the fair.

Sure, ’tis no crime vdinly to swear
By evely power on high,

And call our buried mother’s ghost
A witness to the lie!

Heaven at such perjury connives,

And Venus with a smile forgives.

The n y,mphs and cruel Cupid too,
Sharpening his pointed dart

On an old hone besmeared with blood,
Forbear thy perjured heart.

Fresh youth grows up to wear thy chains,

And the old slave no freedom gains.

Thee, mothers for their eldest sons,
Thee, wretched misers sear,
Lest thy prevailing beauty should
Seduce the hopesul heir3
New married virgins sear thy charms
Should keep their bridegrooms from their arms,

SIR CHARLES SEDLEY. (1639 ?—1701.)

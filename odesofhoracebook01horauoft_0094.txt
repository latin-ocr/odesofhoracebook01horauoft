86 THE onas or HoRAcE.

1. 43. avitus apto cum lare fundus, all these were hred by*
‘Sisztgrn poverty,’ and ‘an ancestral farm with a home fitted to its
l. 45. arbor, Horace had probably in his mind the passage of
Pindar, Nem. viii. 40——
αὕξεται δ’ ἀρετά, χλωραῖς ἐέρσαις ὡς ὅτε δένδρεον ᾄσσει.
‘ Virtue waxeth even as a tree shooteth up fed by tendet dews.’

The glory of the house of Marcellus grows with a growth as
steady and unnoticed as that of a tree which must go on growing
by the (imperceptible) lapse of time. The strangeness of the figure
shows that it did not occur originally to Horace.

Marcellus, ‘the Sword of Italy‚' was the captor of Syracuse, and
otherwise distinguished in the Hannibalic War. Horace puts him
here as a connecting link between the old heroes and Caesar, because
a Marcellus was husband of Octavia, and the child of this marriage
was looked upon as the probable heir to Augustus till he died in 23.

l. 47. Iulium sidus: the comet which appeared after Caesar's
death; here metaphorica] for the ‘star’ of the house.

1. 50⁴ orte saturno: Jupiter.

l. 52. regnes, optative. ‘ Thine be sovereignty, with Caesar for
thy viceroy.'

l. 53. Partho& See Introduction, p. 20.

l. 54. iusto, ‘ a true-earned triumph‘ ; cf. iustum proelium, apitched
battle. Horace probably has in mind the triumph over the Par·

thians celebrated by Antony in Alexandria, which was in no sense
iustus ; neither regularly celebrated nor justified by facts.

l. 5 5. Seras subiectos Orientis orae: the Seres, ‘who lie upon the
fringes of the East.’ Serica stands roughly for the remotest east;
it is doubtful whether the Romans had any commerce with China.

orae is dative after subiectos: so subiicere vesti pannum would
mean ‘to tack on a piece to a garment.'

l. 59. parurn castis, ‘ unholy.' Students should note this way of
expressing a negative idea ε parum gratus, unwelcome, &c.

When lightning struck a place, the sign was taken to prove that
impiety had been committed there, and the spot was covered, not
to be trodden on, and called bzdental. See A. P. 471.

CARMEN XIII.

l. 2. roseam, ‘ lustrous ' : the notion of colour is lost in the more
general one of brightness.

cerea, either ‘smooth’ or ‘ soft‚’ ‘supple‚' as Servius on Virg.
Ecl. ii. 53 explains it.

1. 4. difficili, ‘ ill-digested.’

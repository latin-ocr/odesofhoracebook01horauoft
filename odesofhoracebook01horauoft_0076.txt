68 THE ODES OF HORACE.

l. 4. collegisse iuvat: in Latin the perf. infin„ like the Greek
aorist, is sometimes used with no difference from the present.

meta. ‚evitata The racing- -track for chariots was in the shape
of a long oval. Up it stretched the spina, a long straight stone
ridge. The mela or turning· post was the end of this farthest from
the fiffislu aud the drivers naturally tried to cut the corner as fine as
Ροεει e

l. 5. palma nobilis,‘ the glorious palm’ of victory.

l. 6. Some take terrarum dominos as object of evehit : the race
and prize uplift the lords of lands to the gods. According to this
view, (1) terrarum dominos would apply to the great Siciligan (and
other) princes, Hiero, Thero, &c.‚ whom Pindar glorified. But (2)
the words terrarum dominos may apply to the gods themselves, ‘the
gods, the lords of the world? Aga in (3) the words may refer to the
victories in a sli gyhtl different sense from (1)i. e. ‘raises them to
the very heavens as lords of the world’ (in their own estimation). Cp.
iv. 2. 17‘ quos Elea domum reducit Palma caelestes! Finally (4)
some connect the words with following sentence and make them
refer to the Romans, comparing Romanos rerum dominos gentemque
togatam, Virg. Aen. i. 282.

l. 7. hunc iuvat: the same verb governs illum in l. 9.

l. 8. tergeminis . . . honoribus. Honos is specially used of
official rank: the ‘triple ranks' are the three curule offices, curule
aedileship, praetorship, consulship, in which the cursus honorum or
official career at Rome culminated.

l. 12. Attalicis condicionibus. Attalus Philometor (Attalus

ΙΙΙ) of Pergamus died ιιι 1 33, leaving his kingdom and property to
Rome, to the exclusion of the n'g htful heir Aristonicus. To offer
a man unexpected and undeserved wealth is therefore to offer him
Attalzcas condiciones. Horace says You could never tempt away
the man who delights to till himself the estate os his father, though
you should offer him such terms. Cf. 'neque Attali Ignotus herges

regiam occupavi‚’ ii. 18. 5.
1.13. dimoveas‚ut,‘tempt him away from his harrow to become
a sailor.’

cypria: an example of‘ literary’ epithet. The use of Cypria
here and lllyrloum in the next line adds nothing to the sense, but

a certain richncss to the expression3 cs. in Virgil, G. iii. 12: —
‘Primus Idumaeas referam tibi, Mantua, palmas?

l. 15. Icariis. The Icarian was the S. E. portion os the Aegean

into which Icarus dropped when flying from Crete. The Myrtoan
sea was the S. W. portion. The N. part was called Thracium, and

the S. Creticum.
Africum: the S.W. wind, famous sor its violence· ‚ cf. infr. 3. 12.
l. 16. otium et rura oppidi sui : almost a hendiadys: ‘ the rural
leis-ure of his petty town.’

98 THE omzs or· HoRACE.

called by poets Daunia. Horace here uses the adjective in its Greek
form, ’γῆ Δαυνιάς, δάδος.

1. 15. Iubae tellus. Juba, king of Numidia, took part with the
Pompeians against Caesar, and shared their defeat at Thapsus in
46 13.c. By this act he forfeited his kingdom, which was however
restored to his son Juba by Augustus, in B.c. 30. In B. e. 25 Juba
the younger gave up Numidia, which became a Roman province,
and received in exchange Mauretania and some Gaetulian tribes to
the south os it. This being so, it is quite impossible to decide whether
lubae tellus means Numidia or Mauretania. If the latter, it affixee
a posterior limit for the date of the Ode, as Mauretania could notbe
called Iubae tellus befhre 2 5 Β. c. Personally I think this proves that
the Ode was written before 25 B.c.: else Horace would have said
‘ Juba's new sovereignty ' or the like. Menelik's land would mean
Abyssinia, not the White Nile.

l. 17. pigris, ‘ torpid’ x cf. bruma iners, C. iv. 7. 12.

1. 19. quod latus mundi: a third example of incorporating the
antecedent in the relative clause: the phrase is equivalent to in co
latere mundi quod nebulae malusque urget Iuppiter. Urget, singular,
is attracted into the number of its nearest subject. ‘ Set me in that

quarter of the universe that is oppressed by mists and an unkindly
sky.’ See on 1. 25 supr.‚ sub love.

l. 22. ¹ In a land denied to human habitation.'

l. 2 3. dulce ridentem. The neut. adj. is common in such phrases,
e.g. Sapph0·s ἁδὺ φωνείσας . . . καὶ γελαίσας ἱμερόεν, and Homer's
(11. vi. 484) δακρυόεν γελάσασα.

CARMEN XXIII.

A charming little poem.

You shun me, Chloe', like a strayed fawn that seeks its dam in
the mountains‚ affrighted by every lightest rustle in the brake. Yet
I am no wild beast secking to devour ε cease following your mother,
the time is come for you to wed. ’
E 1ὸὲ.1ις6ἰ1υ.εέθ; trisyllabic form of silvae: so miluus for milvus,

pl 5. ‘ Fgr if spring's coming sends a thrill though rustling leaves.’

inhorruit : ἔνέφριξεν. The perfect here is like the aorist in Greek,
and merely marks the occurrence with no notion of time, past,
present or future.

l. 8. tremit: the subject is hinnuleus,

1. 10. frangere persequor=pe1·sequ0r ut frangam : the poetical
use os the igfirgcigive to express purpose, is adopted from the Greek;
cf. supr. 2. ‚ .

frangere, ‘to erush,' especially between the teeth=‘ crunch ' ;
cp. ‘ glandemque sues fregere sub ulmis,' Virg· G. ii. 7²

11. 19, πο. severus uncus, ‘the stark clamp.' Roman builders
rivetted stones together with iron elamps and mortised them with
melted lead. . T'he point of these attributes, says Wickham, is not
that Necessity is a builder‚ but that the structures which she builds
are compacted for all time.

ll. 21-24 This stanza cannot mean that Hope and Faith desert
t house* when Fortune leaves them; it must mean that Hope
and Faith follow the fortune of a friend in adversity : but ‘ fortune ' in
these two sentences has a different meaning. So in nos servavit Fortuna

v Graecisms from Pindar‚ whose poems he doubtless had before him
in writing the odes·

Parthiam, and Arabia in 26 B. c.

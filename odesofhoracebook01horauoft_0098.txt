90 THE ODES OF HORACE.

1. 36. ignis: note scansion: the second syllable οἷ’ ignis having·
the accent on it is lengthened by a not uncommon licence. So above,
24 Teucer et, where some edd. read Teucer te.

CARMEN XVI.

The poem is addressed to a lady whom he had attacked in the
Epodes, which he calls his iambi, most of them being in that
metre.1t is an amende or apology for a previous attack, and
accordingly is headed m some MSS. palinodia or recantation.

‘,'Burn he says, ‘my verses, fair lady, or throw them in the aea.
Anger made me write them; anger is a madness that has led to the
undoing of many, forgive me and be my friend again!

ll. 2—4. ‘Thou shalt appoint whatever end thou wilt for my
{ffiuxoltpisagersgzsfinw‘hether thou wilt destroy them with flame or in

l. 3. pones is the permissive future. Sive libet (extirpare) flamma,
3⁸va nlarl.

ll. 5-8. No form of frenzy moves the mind so strongly as wrath.
Cf. ‘ Ira furor brevis ests E. i. 2. 62.

Cybele is called Dindymene, because she was worshipped on
Dindymus, a mountain of Phrygia; incola Pythius is Apollo, who
dwelt in the Pythian eave at Delphi; Liber is Bacchus; Cory·
bantes, the daneing priests of Cybele: all were associated with
religious sury.

‘ Not the Lady of Dindymus, nor the Pythian indweller in his
sanctuary‚ nor Bacchus so strongly convulses the spirit os the
priests, not so wildly do the Corybantes rattle their shrill cymbals,
as balesul anger. '—The expression is not quite logical: tristes
ut. irae implies quatiunt mentem, not geminant aera; but the
sense is plain. The meaning is ‘not so spirit· shaking is Cy bele
or Apollo in his shrine or Bacchus or the Cory bants with ytheir
cymbals, as balesul wrath.' The expression is rendered somewhat
inelegant by the fact that only Apollo and the Corybants are further
described, while Cybele and Bacchus are not.

l. 9. Noricus: Noricum was the Tyrol, famous forits ironworks.
l. 10. naufragum : generally ‘ wrecked, ' here ⁴ wrecking.'

l.12.1uppiter ipse: ‘Jupiter' is used of the sky (so sub Iove),
but this passage eombines the two ideas of an avenging God and of
a falling sky. For the latter cf.‘ ruit arduus aether,² Virg. G. i. 324.

11. 13-16. The story is that Prometheus aster the flood of
Deucalion (see 2. 6) was commanded by Zeus to make men out of
the mud, and that he made them of universal sovereignty by giving
to them a portion of every quality possessed by other animals.

prover ia . ”

l. 2. philyra: φιλύρα, properly the lime tree, but here used of the

1. 3. mitto sectari, ‘ omit to seek‚’ ‘ care not to search out.’

11. 5, 6. simplici myrto nihil allaborea sedulus euro. -
Wickham says = non curo ut quidquam allabores sedulus, ‘ 1 do not
desire that you should officiously add any new contrivance to the
plain myrtle‚' Bentley read sedulus cura, cura being imperative.
This means ⁴ cura (ut) nihil allabores sedulus: ‘ see to it that you do
not add anything in officious service? If one accepted Bentley's
reading, it would be better to take cura as abl. of cura, ‘ concern‚’ as
the command is far too emphatic, if cura is a verb. But some edd.
would object to nihil allabores, on the ground that the prohibition
would demand the perf. subj. The rhythm naturally connects
sedulus with curo, but the sense demands that it should be taken
with allabores.

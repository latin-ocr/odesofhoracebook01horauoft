74 THE ODES OF HORACE.

ἒ. 14.d decempedis, ‘ten-foot rules’: suggests the extent of the
CO 011ssst e.

1. 15. metata: a participle from deponent verb in passive sense:
so modulatus, detestatus, abominatus.

privatis, Wiekham says, is abl. agreeing with decempedis. Ι should
prefer to take it as masc. and dative, being dative of advantage.
‘No portico, measured out with ten-foot rules, caught the shady
north sor the pleasure of mere citizens? Ρήυαίιιεεῖδιώτης, one
who is not a magistrate.

1. 16. excipiebat, ‘ caught!

11. 17—20. ‘The laws forbade men to despise the chance-come
sod (sor thatching), but bade them take new-cut stone for town
buildings and temples of the gods, at the public eost)

CARMEN XVI.

Epp. i. 12 Horace recommends him to Iccius, then acting as agent
sor Agrippa in Sicily, where Grosphus had property, as the ode
states.

l. 1. Otium: note the emphatic repetitions in 11. 5. 6. The

simul = simul atque.

1. 3. certa: predicate, ‘ and the stars shine no longer a constant
mark for sailors.'

it Alavortia terra.

11. 7, 8. non gemmis neque purpura venale neque auro,
‘ whose price is above jewels and purple and gold.' For the license of
carrying on a word into the Versus Adonius, cf.

xorius amnis.’—C. i. 2. 19.

lunia vento.'—C. i. 25. 11.
l. 10. Summovet : the technical word ε I, lictor, summove turbam,

will also contain (in the case of the prose books) English
exercises for retranslation into Latin, and for practice
in the art of composition. The aim of the Editors
will be to make each book sels-sufficing, so far as is

ancient classics as literature. For this purpose maps
and plans will be provided, as well as pictorial illustra-
tions of the social life of the ancient world.

14 THE ODES OF HORACE.

poems in the first book may date back to his earliest period
of literary work. The first book of the Epistles appeared
in 20 B.C.¹ and it contains several references to the resent-
ment expressed by Maecenas at his sterility and his prolonged
absences from Rome. Take back your gifts is you will, says
Horace; Iam grateful for them; but I cannot sell my
sreedom and my right to be idle—libem'ma otia 2-1“οι· all
the riches of Araby. Moreover, he says, ‘1 am too old sor
fooling3 philosophy is the proper study sor a man of my
years, not poetry. Let me live the contemplative life,'-a
pretty phrase sor idleness ³.

Horace speaks with the independence os a man who
knows his own mind and his own value. The intimacy with
Maecenas had led to a friendship hardly less close with
Augustus, who wished to attach Horace to his household as
secretary ¹. The poet, however, declined this confidential
position and remained simply his prince’s favourite guest.
ln 17 B.c. a great occasion gave him official recognition as
laureate. Augustus determined to revive the ludi saeculares
or centennial games, observance of which had lapsed. It was
in a sense the jubilee of the principate‚ now fairly and firmly
established as a reign of peace and good order after a
century of war and anarchy: and a central feature of the
games was the great hymn to Phoebus and Diana written by
Horace, and sung under his direction by a chorus of boys

¹ The last Epistle gives the date of the book and os his birth.
Me quater undenos sciat implevisse Decembres
Collegam Lepidum quo (luxit Lollius anna—E. i. 20 fin.

² E. i. 7. 36. The whole Epistle is to this effect.

³ Non eadem est aetas, non mens. . . .
Nunc itaque et versus et cetera ludicra pono,
Quid verum atque decens, curo et rogo et omnis in hoc sum.

E. i. 1. 4sqq.

⁴ Suet. Vit. Augustus ei epistolarum officium obtulit, ut hoc ad
Maecenatem scripto significat, ‘ Ante ipse scribendis epistolis
amicorum sufficiebam; nunc occupatissimus et infirmus Horatium
nostrum a te cupio abducere. Veniet ergo ab ista parasitica mensa
ad hanc regiam et nos in scribendis epistolis iuvabit '

ΑΡΡΕΝΒῙΧ 11 117

oonines: Some MSS. read cultus, ‘ apparel‚’ much inferior in
sense.

lbid. 23-25 ‘ Urgent impavidi te Salaminius

Teucer et Sthenelus sciens
Pugnae.'

Many MSS. read Teucer, te Sthenelus (repeating the
pronoun). This saves a difficulty as to metre‚ the last
syllable of Teucer being short though the foot is a spondee.
It is however clear that Horace uses this license as inl. 36
of the same ode ς and it is easy to understand why et should
have been altered to te to save the metre‚ but hard to see
why te should have been changed to et.

C. 20. 9, 10 ⁴ Caecubum et prelo domitam Caleno
Tu bibes uvarn.²

Porphyrion’s MS. seems to have read tum. If this be right,
the explanation given (by Mr. Ensor) in the note, will hold.
1 incline, however, to think that tu is right, being in strong
eontrast with mea. Horace affects a sort of humility in his
invitation to the rich man: and asks him to drink ordina 're‚
grown in the vineyard which Maecenas had himself bestowed.
See his saying‚ also to the patron :—

‘ Plerumque gratae divitibus vices
Mundaeque parvo sub lare pauperum
Cenae sine aulaeis et ostro
Sollicitam explicuere frontem.’—C. iii. 29. 13—16.

Munro suggested vides=‘ you provide.'

C. 31. 9-12 ‘ Premant Calena falce quibus dedit
Fortuna vitem: dives et aureis
Mercator exsiccet culullis
Vina Syra reparata merce!

Some MSS. read ut for et in 1. 10. It is better to have two
instances of wealth and luxury than one.

C. 32. 15. For mila· cunque edd. have proposed meli-

{Zlmqt’ce and medicumque, ‘with dulcet note ' and with ‘ healing
m.

C. 35. 17 ‘Te semper anteit saeva Necessitas.'
Many MSS. read serva3 but this probably came in as
a gloss explaining anteit: ‘precedes as a servant.’

Ibid. 39 ‘ Diffingas retusum! Bentley reads dqfingas re—
coctum, ¹ melt and forge anew.’

tOther textual differences are referred to in the explanatory
no es.

nores. 79

ll. 9-11. Horace states with great vconciseness what he has:—
honour, wit, and position.

l. ιο. Benigno vena: vena, as in a mine; benigna, ‘ boun-
teous: Cf. malignus, ‘niggardly‚' e. g. Virg. Aen. vi. 270 ‘per
incertam lunam sub lnce maligna.’

11. 11, 12. nihil supra. Deos lacesso: lacesso, ‘ to trouble for,'
here governs two accusatives as a verb of asking. So also flagito
amicum >largior-a, ‘ 1 importune my friend for larger bounty.'

l. 12. potentem amicum: Maecenas.

l. 14. beatus, like ὄλβιος, means ⁶ rich.’

sabinia: neut. pl. agreeing with praedia, ‘ rich enough with my
single Sabine sarm.' Some take satis as meaning ‘ crops!

n. 15, 16. This thought is expanded finely in C. iv. 7. 9. 'Prndi-
tur dies die is the same metaphor as ver proterit aestas, ‘ summer
treads on the heel of spring! The moral is the same. Nature

shows that all passes: yet on the grave's very brink the n'ch man
begins to build palaces.

ll. 17, 18. 'I'u secanda marmora Locus. Locare (louer, Fr.)
means ‘to let' or ‘ give a contr-aet for! Conducere, ‘to hire' or
‘ take a contract.’ The gerundive construction is always used of the
thing contracted for.

l. 18. sub ipsum funus ε so suh noctem, ‘ at nightfall?

ll. 1 8. 19. sepulcri immemor ι a fine touch. ‘ Yon give a contract
for hewing marble : it would be right if it were sor your tomb; but
no——yon build new habitations ‘³ ou the brink of the grave.” '

ll. 20-22. A well-known difficulty. The Romans had at this
period a craze for building houses out into the sea on piles: possibly
for convenience in bathing. Cf. C. iii. ²4 3 :

‘ Caementis licet occupes
Tyrrhenum omne tuis et mare Apulicnrn.'

l. 20. Baiis: a sashionable watering-place on the shores of the
Lucrine lake : constantly mentioned in Horace, who delighted in its
hot springs

ll. 20, 21. urges summovere, ‘ you hasten on to c’ear away from
your path the beach os the sea which roars against Baiae! On sum-
movere see on 16. 10 supr. The shore is taken as blocking the way ς
therefore I translate l. 2 2 Parum locuples continente ripa as ‘ not
rich enough while the shore holds you in check.' Wiekham, how-
ever, says ‘ not rich enough to thy taste in the possession of the shore
of the mainland.’ Some also take it as ‘ the adjoining shore!

l. 23 sqq. The thought takes a new turn. ‘Nay, worse; you are
not only short-sighted in your greed; you are unjnst, and heap up
by fraud gold which cannot buy you a new lease of life. Death is
no respectet of persons]

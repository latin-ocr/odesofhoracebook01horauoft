APPENDIX II

ΟΝ THE REAmNGs Anop‘rm).

THE text used is that of the Oxford Pocket Text: from
this 1 depart twice on a matter of punctuation.

1. In 2. 40 Ι put a full stop at hostem, because the two
preceding stanzas have referred back to venias in 1. 30,
whereas this refers to redeas in l. 45, as its main verb.

2. In 12. 21 1 put the full stop at audax, preferring to refer
proeliis audax to Pallas rather than to Liber.

I omit 25. Also in Ode 28, 1 print the whole as a continuous
monologue‚ not as a dialogue between Nauta and Archytas.
The reasons are explained in the note on that ode.

{he principal points which need discussion in the text are
as ollows :—

C. 2. 39 ‘ Mauri peditis.5 All MSS. read this, but Bentley
objected that the Moors were ‘neither brave nor foot-soldiers
nor close fighters.’ He accordingly read Marsi, which means
simply Italian. But when Horace is choosing an ethno-
graphical or geographical term he does not trouble himself
much as to the sense3 and the difficulty is not sufficient
to warrant a wholly unauthorized change.

C. 12. 31 ‘Et minax-quod sic voluere—ponto
Unda recumbit!

Most MSS. read quia sic, which will not scan. One
reads qui sic which is nonsense- no doubt an attempt to
reduce quia to metre. Others read di sic or nam sic,
obviously conjectures. Probably a scholiast wrote on the
margin of an old text quia as indicating the sense of quod,
and so the word got into the text. Porphyrion, the oldest
scholiast, read quod.

C. 12. 57 ‘Te minor latum reget aequus orbem.’ Many
MSS. read laetum, which gives also a good sense, ‘exulting
in his sway.'

C. 15. 19, 20 ‘Tamen heu serus adulteros Crines pulvere

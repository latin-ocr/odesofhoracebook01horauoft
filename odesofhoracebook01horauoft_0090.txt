82 THE oDEs oF HoRACE.

Two points in the construction should be noted :—

(1) dum terret refers to past, not to present, time, and is
indicative though a dependent verb in Oratio Obliqua, The rule is
that, when dum (meaning ‘ while ') refers to an action which goes on
parallel with that of the principal verb, the verb in its clause is of
the same tense as the principal verb; or, if the sentence be in Oratio
Obliqua, in the appropriate tense of the subjunctive, e.g.;

‘ Dum Caesar castra muniebat, Galli procedebant)

‘ While Caesar was fortisying his camp (say from Monday to
wednesday), the Gauls were advancing.’

But if the clause with dum refers to a longer period, at a point
in which the action of the main verb took place, dum is followed
by the present indicative, even in Oratio Obliqua, So

⁸ Dum Caesar castra munit, legatus interfectus est?

‘ while Caesar was sortifying his camp, the legate was killed:

Putting the two sentences into Oratio Obliqua, they would be
s dum Caesar castra muniret, Gallos procedere.

( dum Caesar castra munit, legatum interfectum esse?

(2) m'si reddidisses is in virtual Oratio Obliqua after terret:
that is to say it represents words which Apollo is supposed to have
said. They would be in the direct (Occidam te), nisi reddideris
(Fut. psA, in indirect nisi reddidisset. Therefore risit dum terret=
dum dicit se occisurum esse te nisi reddidisses, risit. The historic
tense of reddidisses is necessary aster the historic main verb risit.

ll. 13-16. After the death of Hector, Priam set out alone to the
camp of the Greeks that he might beg Achilles to restore the bod
for burial: Jove sent Mercury to watch over him and give him safye
conduct to the tent of Achilles and success in his embassy.

‘Nuntiatum est,

l. 13. Atridas: Menelaus and Agamemnon.

1. 15. 'thessalos ignes : the fires of Achilles’ soldiers.
iniqua. Troiae eastra, ‘ the mmp hostile to Troy.'

l. 16. fefellit, ‘stole past’

11. 17 20 refer to Mercury as ψυχοπομπός, convoyer of the souls.
⁶ Thou dost bestow the souls of the righteous in the mansions of bliss‚
and dost with thy wand control the disembodied company; accept-
able thou artto the gods above and the gods below'; cf. infr. ²4.
18. The rod or heralds’ staff (caduceus) is always an attribute of
Mercur .

Noteythe use os turba, constant in verse, as a loose general phrase
sor ‘ people.' levem: cs. Soph. Ajax, 126:

ὁρῶ ’γὰρ ἡμᾶς οὐδὲν ὄντας ἄλλο πλὴν
εἴδωλ’ ὅσοιπερ ζῶμεν, ἦ κούφην σκιάν.

levem turbam, like domus exilis Plutonia in i. 4. 17, is
probably suggested by Homer's νεκύων ἀμενηνὰ κάρηνα.

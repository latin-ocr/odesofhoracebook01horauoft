CARMEN VII.

This dactylic metre (the Alcmam'an) is only used three times3
here, in the twenty-eighth Ode and in the twelfth Epode.

Plancus was one os Caesar's generals in the Gallie war. At the date
οἱ Caesar's death he was governing Southem Gaul, and sor a con·
siderable time wavered between Antony and the Senate, but finally
joined the triumvirs. He sided with Antony against Octavian,
but deserted in the year 3² B.c. before the battle of Actium. This
ode was plainly written after Actium, while Plancus was resident
in Rome.

Lines 1—14 have no connexion with what follows, except the bare
mention of Tibur. Analysis shows this.

Others will sing the famous sites of Greece; nothing delights

But, Plancus, whether you be in camp or at your Tiburtine villa.
remember to be merry. Teucer was merry even in his flight.

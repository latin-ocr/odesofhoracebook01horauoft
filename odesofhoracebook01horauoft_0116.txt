108 THE omas or HORACE-

lgefz §13:255ss ‚higc setorm-tossed bark to the sea-washed shore, would sing

l. 11. Lycus was a friend of Alcaeus.
l. 14. testudo τ see on 10. 6.

1. 15. mihi is simply the ethic dative ι salve mihi, ⁸ Hail thou,
whenever Ι call thee in due fashion.'

cunque standing alone does not occur elsewhere. All the MSS.
have it, and scholiasts explain as = quandocunque, ‘ whenever.' It
must be a contractiori of cumcunque, which occurs (with tmesis)
Lucr. 2. 114 ‘ cnm solis lumina cumque Insertim fundunt radios?
For the contraction cf. quandoque for quandocunque, C. iv. 1. 17.

CARMEN XXXIII.

Albius Tibullus was a member of the literary set which included
Virgil. Horace, Propertius and Ovid. The fourth Epistle os the
first book is also dedicated to him. Horace here seeks to console
his friend for the inconstancy of Glycera, by pointing out the un-
reasonableness of everybody when it comes to love-making. It is
noteworthy that Tibullus writes in his own poems of Delia and
Neaera, but Glycera does not appear there.

ll. 2-4. ‘never whine out plaintive ditties, asking why saith is
broken and a younger rival outshines you.'

In this and other places, Wickham (supported by Munro and
other excellent authorities) seeks to avoid assigning to ne with the
pres. subj. that force of direct prohibition which properly belongs
to the perf. subj. Hence Wickham translates ‘ To prevent your
grieving‚ consider these sacts.’ However, it seems impossible to
deny that the pres. subj. may be used in direct prohibition, at least
in poetry. Cp. C. ii. 1. 37; iv. 9. 1.

eur . . . praeniteat: an indirect question implying some such
verb as rogans aster decantes.

decantare is contemptuous: it is used elsewhere of children
chanting over the catchword of a game. ‘Nenia . . . decantata
Camillis‚' E. i. 1. 64.

l. 5. insignem tenui fronte: low foreheads were counted
a beauty at Rome: so Horace says ⁴ Give me back my youth':
⁸ reddes nigros angusta fronte capillos,' E. i. 7. 26. But in calling
the forehead angusta or tenuis the Romans seem to have meant
‘ with the hair growing low down on it! A forehead rendered high
b‘y the receding of the hair from it was with them, and still is with
us, a blemish and disfigurement. It is remarkable how the Romans
shrank from baldness.

l. 6- Cyri . . . amor, ‘ passion sor Cyrus ’; objective genitive.

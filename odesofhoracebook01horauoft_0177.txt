INTRODUCTION TO BOOK 11

-φφ-

ῘΤ is not easy to detect any general distinguishing character
in this book of the Odes. As contrasted with the first, it is
singulm-ly deficient in metrical variety. Twelve out of its
twenty poems are A1caie; six of the remaining eight are
Sapphic; and the book offers only four metres in all as
against ten in the first, six in the third, and eight in the
fourth (which has only fifteen poems). Like the third book
it concludes with an ‘envoy’ in which the poet asserts his
claim to immortality; but the ode of the third book is sar
more dignified and serious in tone. The opening ode, too,
with its graver strain 11an deprecated, half apologized for,
by the light conclusion, is in strong contrast with the great
series of Alcaic exhortations to Rome and the Romans that
commence the third book. Nevertheless, among these poerns
am some of Horace’s very best and most characteristic
lyrics, for instance the third and sourteenth odes; some of the
most often quoted, notably the second, tenth and sixteenth‚
where he condenses familiar moral precepts into the easily
remembered Sapphic stanza3 and some os the most charming‚
like the address to Barine‚ or the invitations to old friends
in the sixth and seventh. It is extraordinary how Horace
has managed in these last to invest trifles with dignity and
yet never sacrifice the lightness of his touch. The moral
and intellectual standpoint is almost curiously consistent

throughout them; it is the easy philosophy of a contented
bachelor

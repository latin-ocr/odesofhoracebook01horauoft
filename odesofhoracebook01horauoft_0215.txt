CARMEN VII.

To Pompeius Varus, a. fellow soldier in the army of Brutus who
had continued to fight after the defeat at Philippi, but had now
leave to return in the general amnesty. This poem also is a very
touching exprmiou os friendship. See Introduction, p. 11, sor
Horaoe's part at Philippi,

1. 1. Translate: ‘O thou that with me wert osten brought to a
desperate hour.'

ultimus, like novissimus or extremus, often means · desperate, ’as
we say ⁸ in the last extremity.’ tempus, like καιρός, is ‘ crisis)
l. 3. redonavit: this verb occurs twice in Horace and in no other
writer. Cf. C. iii. 3. 30:
‘Protinus et graves
Iras et invisum nepotem,

Troica quem peperit sacerdos
Marti redonabo?

In both places it has a sense allied to condonare, ‘ give and forgive!
Quiritem, a citizen of Rome ; either ‘ with full civic rights*
not capitis minor (an outlaw)‚ or ‘a civilian.' Julius Caesar, in
addressing the tenth legion when it mutinied, spoke the single word
Quirites, which implied that they were disbanded.
l. 5. Pompei, a dissyllable.

ll. 6-8. ‘ With whom I ‘osten broke day's tediousness with wine,
wearing a garland on my locks that glistened with Syrian ointmentl

L 8. ualebathro with nitentem not with coronatus.

1. 10. relicta non bene parmula, ‘ when my shield was vilely
oest away.’ Aloeeus, the famous lyric poet, also lost his shield in
battle; this may probably have induced Horace to mention the fact.

tthI 2. tetigere mento : either in death or in submission, probably
e ormer.

l. 13. Mercury was the god of luck and of safe conduct. Horace
claims to be his savonrite, infr. 17. ²9·

l. ι 5. resorbens: the wave threw Horace high and dry, bnt its
backward snck oesried Pompeius out to a sea of storms.

l. 17. obligatam redde Iovi dapem, ‘ pay to Jove the feast you
vowed him! This poetioel variation on the nse os obligo does not
occur elsewhere. Prometheus obligatus aliti ngod. 1'·. 67) is
hardly the same thing, as it probably means ‘in thraldom to the
vulture? Everywhere else the word is used os the person who is
bound to pay a debt: so infr. 8. 5 obligasti caput = obligasti te;
here it is used of the debt which he is bound to pay. The words
are really equivalent to redde Iovi dapem quam ut reddas oblzgraris.

L 18. latua, ‘ (rame)

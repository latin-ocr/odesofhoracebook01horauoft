24 THE ODES OF HORACE.

followed by three trochees. The second verse is usually
described as a trimeter iambic. But dactyls and trochees
are not employed in the same system with iambics. There
is just the same reason for making this verse trochaic as
for so describing the third verse of the Alcaic, which is now
recognized as being trochaic with anacrusis. On the same
principle the second verse of theffirst stasimonin Soph. Oed.
R. is rightly described as troch. dim. cat. with anacrusis, not
iamb. dim. See Kennedy's Studia Sophoclea on this point.

Three minor Sapphics followed by a Versus Adonius.

In the minor Sapphic Horace generally keeps the caesura.
after the fifth, syllable: in the later odes however he not
unfrequently has it after the sixth, e. g. Phoebe silvarumque Ι
potens Diana. The metrica] effect os the two caesuras is
widely different.

Iam sat Ι is terr Ι is ΙΙ nivis Ι atque Ι dirae

Grandin Ι is mis Ι it ΙΙ pater Ι ac rub Ι ente

Dexter Ι a sac 1 ras ΙΙ iacul Ι atus arces
Terruit urbem.

9. Major Sapphic. C. 8, not elsewhere.

-υ Ι--Ι-υυ- Ι-υυΙ-υΙ-υ
Lydia Ι dic per Ι omnes Ι
Te de Ι os or Ι o Sybarin Ι cur proper Ι es am lando.

The first is versus Aristophanicus : the second a common
Sapphic with a choriambus inserted before⁴ the dactyl.

10. Alcaic. C. 9, 16, 17, 26, 27, 29, 31, 34, 35 37.

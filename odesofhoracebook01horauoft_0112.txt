is said therefore to have been ‘ a second time ' (in the person of*
Pythagoras) ‘ sent down to Orcus, though by unhooking’ (in the person

an smews.

Archytas inclined to the toeching of Pythagoras.

1. 17. alios: in antithesis to nautis.

1. 18. exitio: the dative of purpose or design is sometimes sub-
stituted for nominative or accusative in apposition. One could write

either hoc fermentum tibi habe, or hocfermento tibi habe.

l. 20. fugit, ‘ avoids? See Virg. Aen. 4 698. None could die till
Proserpine severed a lock' of hair from the head. The verb is in the
perf.‚ as is shown by the quantity of the penult. The perf. is some-
times used to signify that which is habitual or constantly reem-ring.
Proserpina comes to every head to cut the lock of hair and free the
imprigoned spirit. A good example of this aoristic perfect is sustulit,
34 1 ·

l. 21. me quoque, the unburied man whose ghost speaks.

1. 22. Notus: the south wind is called ‘the swift comrade os

you from those who have the power to give—from favouring Jove and
Neptune, the warden of holy Tarentum.'

l. 27. plectantur. The verb plecti refers especially to unde-remed
or vicarious suffering as in ‘Quidquid delirant reges, plectuntur
Achivi,' E. i. 2. 14; ‘tergo plector] ‘I pay for it with my back,’
S. ii. 7. 105 ; ‘ admisso plectitur ille meo, Ov. Her. xi. 110.

l. 30. neglegis, ‘ Dost think it a light matter that thou shouldest
do a wrong, that will presently recoil upon thy innocent children.’
neglegere, in this sense to slight, is common with noun objects, as
neglegere minas, but rare with an infinitive or dependent clause; cf.
however, ‘neglegens ne qua populus laboret‚‘ C. iii. 8. 25.

l. 31. te natis are to be taken together, like ‘semet prognatos:

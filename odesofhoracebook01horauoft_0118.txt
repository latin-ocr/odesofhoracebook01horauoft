110 THE ODES oF HORACE. ⁷

apicem: the tiara of Eastern kings: at Rome used only for the⁴
flamen's conical cap.

sustulit and posuisse are both gnomic perfects equivalent to the
Greek aorist. The perfect, like the Greek aorist, is often used where
we use the present in γνῶμαι, maxims or general aphorisms: so
A. P. 343 ‘Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci,' ‘ He wins
every vote who mixes pleasure and profit.'

CARMEN XXXV.

A very difficult and obscure poem, which may be analyzed thus:
O Fortune, you are omnipotent‚ and dreaded by all (1—16). Before
you walks Constraint‚ carrying nails and wedges in her brazen hand,
and the clamp and molten lead (that is, apparently, the symbols of
firm building). Hope and white-robed Faith attend you when you
leave the mansions of the mighty in distress: bnt false friends
desert (at this point the meaning of Fortuna changes; she is no
longer the dispenser of fate, but the star of an individual man to
which Hope and Faith are constant even in adversity). ‘ Keep
Caesar safe in his foreign wars (here fortuna becomes again the arbi—
tress), and direct hencesorth the swords blunted in civil war against
the enemies of Rome.’

l. 1. At Antium, a town of Latium, which stood on a promontory
running into the Tyrrhene Sea, was a Temple of Fortune.

l. 2. praesens, ‘ potent ' : cf. ‘ a very present help in trouble!

l. 5. ambit, ‘courts’ ι lit. ‘goes round,’ ‘canvasses,' from the
phrase ambire tribus.

l. 6. te (ut) dominam aequoris (ambit) quicunque, δια,
⁴ and thee as lady of the seas courts whatsoever mariner in Bithynian
bark affronts the Carpathian main.'

1. 7. lacessit τ as if the sea were a wild beast [VVickham].

l. 9. te Dacus asper (metuit) te (metuunt) profugi scythae:
Dacia covered the modern T ransylvania and part of Hungary.
The Scythae lived in Russia, and were mounted archers like the

Parthians: hence profugi.

l. 13. ne . . . neu. lVeu is used because the danger is not a fresh
one, but only a consequence of the first. The metaphor of kicking
{egvgrcphotlieerpilllagmof the state is found in (and probably taken from)

l. 15. ad arma ε for the short syllable see on 9. 1. Note the fine
sonnd of this line.

1. 17. On the reading serva see Appendix‚ p. 117.

ll. 17-20. Why Constraint‚ tbe builder of dungeons, should go
before Fortune is not clear.

battles with the winds os the North.’ For the force of de· as prefix
cf. depraeliari, debellam cf. Virg. G. i. 318 ‘Omnia ventorum con-
currere proelia vidi) Horace repeats in a frigid and hackneyed tone
the metaphor by which a whirling tempest is said to be the battle
os the winds, as is they were all blowing at once. It was originated
by Aeschylus, P. V. 1085 :—

“flpgssatg ἀνέμων πνεύματα »πάντων

‘Blasts of all the winds leap upon one another, displaying to the
world the strife os gust with gast!

Adjectives in -bilis have sometimes an active sense, so flebilis,

l. 2 5. audax . . . perpeti: not a prose construction; see on i. 1.
183 the prose nse would be audax ad perpetienda. There are
four Pythagorean elements‚ earth, air, fire, and water; the first is
man’s inheritance, but he will not be contented with it, insisting
impiously on trying to master the other three. And so the poet
gives examples os the fate that has met men who tried the other
elements. virgil is on the sea and precedents are against him.
Prometheus brought fire to mortals fraude mala, and his sate should

suffered for it. [1 owe this very ingenious note to Mr. E. Ensor.]

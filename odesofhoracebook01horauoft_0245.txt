ODE xv11. 27-29.

Me truncus illapsus celebro
Sustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum
Dextra levasset.

The ordinary way of stating this in prose would be Me
truncus illapsus sustulisset, nisi Faunus ictum levasset.
This is the ordinary type of a conditional sentence, referring
to past time in both condition and result, which implies
by its form that the condition was not fulfilled, and therefore
that the result did not ensue. Directly sustulisset is read,
the reader has no concern as to Horace’s safety. ‘ A falling
tree would have made an end ⁰f me! What difference does
it make that sustulerat is used? Wickham says: ‘The
indicative is a rhetorical exaggeration‚ “ I was dead, had not
Faunus stayed the blow.’'’ This overstates the case. The
pluperfect indicative for plupersect subjunctive is a perfectly
well recognized variant in such cases, but only occurs in
RQ? {³2⁶¹{v22‘5213231¹,5>‚ ¹355 ‘3221'133‘52222233 ¹1¹? ‘3152ssss
first in such sentences. 'Similarly, in English, one might
say, ‘A falling tree had killed me, had not Faunus inter-
posed ’ς but in ordinary speech, one would always use ‘ would
have killed.' It is not an irregularity, but a poetical type
of the conditional sentence; and, it should be added,
when it is used, writers osten so arrange the words as to
throw emphasis on the result which did not follow, The
difference between it and the ordinary-structure is merely
a difference in tone.

The rhetorical exaggeration‚ of which Wickham speaks,
is found in passages where there is real irregularity of
structure—

70 THE ODES OF HORACE.

dl {0- Mirantur utrumque dicere. The prose use would require
acen em.

ll. 30-32. The Shades crowd round each poet, shoulder to shoulder,
but they prefer Alcaeus. The order is sed vulgus, densum
humeris, magis (more gladly) bibit aure pugnas et exactos
tyrannos (i. e. carmen de pugnis et exactis tyrannis).

l. 32· bibit aure: as we say ‘ drinks in the recital.’

l. 33. stupens, ‘ rapt with‘; cf. ‘ Hic stupet attonitus rostris:
virg. Geo. ii. 508.

11. 34, 35. Demittit atras aures belua. centiceps. Cerberus
(to whom Horace allows a hundred heads in place of three) drops

his pricked ears: the watch-dog ceases to watch. Cf. Epod. 6. 7
aure sublata, used of a questing hound.

l. 35. centiceps. Hesiod calls him πεντηκοντακᾶρηνονς Pindar,
according to an old commentator, ἑκατοντακάρηνον. Arithmetic is
out of place in these matters,

l. 36. Eumenidum, lit. ‘the kind ladies,' is a characteristic Greek ,

euphemism sor the furies. So in the modern tongue small-pox is
εὐλογία, ‘ the blessing.’
recreantur: are quickened by the song.

l. 37. Quin is here merely an emphatic particle like καὶ μήν.

Prometheus, the Titan, who stole fire from heaven for men, was
chained to a rock, and a vulture continually gnawed his lrver. But
in the ordinary form of the legend, the rock was in the Caucasus,
and Prometheus was set free by Hercules. Horace has this version,
however, infr. 18. 35, and Epod. 17. 67.

Pelopis parens. Tantalus, who sor his sins was set in Hades up
to the waist in water that always receded from his lips; over his
head hung fruit, which the wind swung away as osten as he stretched
out to it.

1. 38. Dulci laborum decipitur sono, ‘by the sweet sound is
beguiled out of his agonies.'

decipitur, as osten in Horace, agrees with nearest subject, though
logically constructed with both. The genitive laborum is a poetic
construction imitated from the Greek, where κλέπτεται πόνων might
easily stand sor λήθεται πόνων.

l. 39. Orion: a hunter giant who lived in Crete in sellowship
with Diana. The cause of his death is variously stated. Horace
(C. iii. 4. 70) says that he attempted to ravish the goddess and was
slain by her arrow :

‘Notus et integrae
Tentator Orion Dianae,
Virginea domitus sagitta!
The pursuits of his life would follow him into Hades, just as Alcaeus

50 THE ODES OF HORACE.

perilous hazard—-and your progress is over flames that lurk beneath v
treacherous cinders.’

l. 1. ex Metello consule. Metellus and Afranius were consuls in
60 B.e. when Caesar, Pompey and Crassus formed that league which
was nicknarned (not officially styled) the Triumvirate. They, and
the later Triumvirs‚ are the principe& referred to. Princeps means
chief among equals; it does not convey distinction of rank.

1. 3. Ludumque Fortunae. Cf. C. iii. 29. 49 z

‘ Fortuna saevo laeta negotio et
Ludum insolentem ludere pertinax.'

1. 6. Periculosae. The anacrusis though commonly short in
Horace's Greek models is rarely so in his verse—eighteen times

only in the first two lines of the stanza, ten times in the third. He ·

never shorteus this syllable in the numerous Alcaic odes of Book IV,
which represents his latest manner.

ll. 7, 8. Horace means: Though it is peace now, the passions of
the Civil VVars are still living. You are like a man walking on
ashes which he takes to be burnt out 3 but fire is buming underneath

them.
h· 1159-12. Pollio had ceased to write tragedies while occupied with
is istor .

ll. 10— ly 4. ‘ Presently, when you have set out iu their order public
eventS, you will return with Attic buskin to your high vocafion,
O Pollio, you that are a tower of strength to those who tremble at
the judgernent bar and to the senate in debate.’ ” ·

1. 12. cecropio . . . cothurno. The cothurnus was the high-

heeled boot worn by tragic actors‚ comic actors wearing the soccus or
low slipper; cf. Milton's phrase in Il Penseroso:

‘Or what, though rare, of later age
Ennobled hath the buskined stage?

So Virgil in Ecl. viii. 10, addressing Pollio, writes z
‘Sola Sophocleo tua carmina digna cothumo.’

Cecropio. Cecrops was the legendary king of Attica, and
Cecropidae is osten used sor Athenians. All Roman plays were
imitations, if not absolutely translations, of the Attic drama.

l. 13. reiS. Any defendant was a reus, whether in civil or crimiual
actionS.

l. 16. Dalmatico . . . triumpho: see note on Pollio, above.

ll. 17—24. Already, says Horace, your history brings to mind
sights and memories of the Civil War as if they were present.

l. 18. Perstat-iugis aures, ⁴ you deafen our ears.' Perstringere
means ‘to graze’; so Virg. Aen. x. 344, femur perstrinxit Achatae.
Hence, to take the edge off a thing, aciem gladii perstringam hence,
to take the kcenness off a sense, to dull. Praestringo is used in the

Sil-Ine way.

INTRODUCTION TO BOOK 1. 25

The first two verses consist of an anacmsis followed by
a strong trochaie dipody and two dactyls. A strong troch.
dip. is one in which the second trochee is replaced by
a spondee. The third verse is an anacrusis followed by two
strong troch; dipodiis. [lt is in this strengthening os the
troch. dip. that Horace has modified the practice or his
Greek models.] ΤΙιε last verse is a logaoedic or dactyls
followed by trochees.

Ο Ι Diva Ι gratum ΙΙ quae regis Ι Antium
Prae Ι sens vel Ι imo ΙΙ tollere Ι de gradu
Mor Ι tale Ι corpus Ι vel su Ι perbos
Vertere Ι funeri Ι bus tri Ι amphos.
The first syllable of the first three verses is called the

anacrusis or ‘up-beat,’ and is occasionally short in Horace
and commonly so in his Greek models.

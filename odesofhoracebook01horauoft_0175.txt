As a moralist, he has been strangely commended, seeing
that when he descends from generalities to give a particular
recommendation it is frequently immoral. As a critic, he
exercised ,for eighteen centuries almost unquestioned dic-
tatorship. Critics like Boileau practically admitted no
appeal from his judgement. N owadays we hold other
opinions, and incline to ask what Horace was about
that he did not recognize the genius os Catullus and
Lucretius. Yet his practical precepts‚ his insistence upon
eonscientious and finished workmanship, were no doubt of
great value to his own age and are of permanent application.
Jgiterature under Augustus became the fashion5 and Horace
inculcated upon a ‘ mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease'
the duty of polish, ‘the labour of the file ¹.’ Many of his
utterances were strained by critics who neglected his main
recommendation to study the Greek models² and were content
with the second-hand versions made by those Latins whom
he criticized. For instance, because Horace declared that
uagedy disdains to babble trivial verses, a hard and‘fast
canon of style came into being which rejected from serious

⁷ poetry all words that were not ‘noble,' and would condemn

the finest passage of Othello because Desdemona talks of her
handkerchief· But it is difficult to discover any criticism
in the Ars Poetica and Epistles which is not at least excellent
sense 3 unless it be the famous recommendation that a poem
should b‘e kept nine years before it is given to the world³ ; as

if a man capable of doing good work did not know when
he had done jt.

In his personal appearance Horace was short and sat·⁴:

¹ Limaelabon—A. P. ²91·

² Vos exemplaria Graeoe

Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna. —A. P. 268.

³ Siquid tamen olim

Scripseris, in Maeci descendat iudicis aures,
Et patris et nostras, nonumque prematur in annum —A. P. 386.

Ad summum totus modiilti bipedalis—SE ιι. 3. 308.

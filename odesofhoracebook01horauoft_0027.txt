As a moralist‚ he has been strangely commended, seeing
that when he doecends from generalities to give a particular
recommendation it is frequently immoral. As a critic, he
exercised for eighteen centuries almost unquestioned dic·
tatorship. Critics like Boileau practimny admitted no
appoel from his judgement. N owadays we hold other
opinions, and incline to ask what Horace was about
that he did not recognize the genius of Catullus and
Lucretius. Yet his practical preceps, his insistence upon
conscientious and finished workmanship, were no doubt os
great vaJue to his own age and are os permanent application-
Literature under Augustus beoeme the fashion, and Horace
inculcated upon a ‘ mob of gentlemen who wrote with oese’
the duty of polish, ‘the labour of the file ¹.' Many of his
utterancoe were strained by critics who neglected his main
recommendation to study the Greek models² and were content
with the second-hand versions made by those Latius whom
he criticized. For instance, because Horace declared ‘that
tragedy disdains to babble trivial verses, a hard and {ast
mnon of style came into being which rejected from serious
poet-ryall words that were not ‘noble‚' and would condemn
the finest passage of Othello because Desdemona talks os her
rhandkerchief· But it is difficult to discover any criticism
in the Ars Poetica and Epistles which is not at least excellent
sense ; unless it be the famous recommendation that a poem
shouldbe kept nine years before it is given to the world⁸; as
if a man oepable of doing good work did not know when
he had done it.

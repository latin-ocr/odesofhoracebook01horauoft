20 THE ODES OF HORACE.

Augustus said he was like ‘a little pint pot ¹.’ His hair had
been black ², but was grizzled and receding from the temples
when he wrote the Epistle to Maecenas. He suffered from
sore eyes ³. His temper was quick but not resentful ⁴. He
liked to sit huddled up with a book by the fire in winter
and to lounge in the sun in summer ⁵. He liked good
wine and plenty of sleep ⁶. In his youth he was ambitious
of literary fame3 but having acquired celebrity and a com-
petence‚ he felt in himself no creative impulse or mission,
such as urged Milton to write⁷. Dr. Johnson’s is an
instance of a not dissimilar temperament. F ew personalities
in literature are so well known to us, and few, if any,
are more amiable.

Contractusque leget.- E. i. 7. 11.
Vini somnique benignus—S. ii. 3. 3.

Quod non desit habentem
Quae poterunt unquam satis expurgare cicutae
Ni melius dormire putem quam scribere versus ?-E. ii. 2. 52.

CARMEN IX.

The theme os the ode is change. Nothing in Nature is continual z
yet you, O Valgius, continually grieve sor the boy Mystes· But
parents even have not wept for ever for their sous ; oease, and rather
mghcefcglgsgrlnglugepflged. Some have seen a reference in 18—24
to the events of Β. c. 20, when Augustus was in Asia, and Tiberius,
by au advance into Armenia, srightened Phraates, King of Parthia,
into restoring the standards and prisoners taken at Carrhae. But
Horace was so much impressed by all that related to Carrhae that
he would scarcely have sailed to dwell ou the restitution; and all

Note the highly artificial structure of the poem and the series of
words. Non semper (1) . . . usque (4) . . . menses per omnes (6)

. . semper (9), non omnes annos (13, 14, 15) . . . semper (17).
Horace leaves off his exhortation with the same *word which began it.

1. 1. hispidoe, ‘ dishevelled ’ ; lit. ‘shaggy ' ; a very graphic word
to descnbe the look of a country after long rain.

CARMEN XX.

An invitation to Maecenas to share Horace’s humble fare, very
prettily worded. ‘ 1 will only give you cheap Sabine wine; but
1 bottled it and scaled it myself the day when you were applauded
in the thcatre? Mr E. Ensor suggests to me that the invitation
is to celebrate an anubem-ary, March 1, which was the date both of
Horaee's esoepe from the falling tree (see C. iii. 8), and os a great
reception given to Maecenas in the theatre aster his recovery from
illness; see C. ii. 17. 21, where utrumque nostrum incredibili malo
consentit astrmn certainly seems to imply at lfflst that tlte two
events happened on the same day os the year. The vile Sabinum
then is to be drunk on sentimental grounds, because it was bottled
to commemorate the occasiom but only modicis cantharis (under-
standing modicis as ‘ moderate’3 cf. 18. 7 modici Liberi). Then
(after they have done their duty to sentiment), Horace will have up
his best wine (reading with Porph.‚ &c., tum bibes) z though his
best is only Caecuban, not Falernian. Horace had good wine sor
hisother friends (cf. C. iii. 21. 53 i. 17. τις iii. 28. 3); and asor-tion·
would not ask Maecenas to drink only his home-grown Sabinum
(Epist. i. 5). Tum is rightly used os an immediate sequence3
otherwise deinde or postea would be used.

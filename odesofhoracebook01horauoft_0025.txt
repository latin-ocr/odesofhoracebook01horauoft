INTRODUCT 1014. 17

Yet he is a poet without passion and a moralist without
originality. The other Latin poets who wrote of love
oelebrate a single mistress; Catullus his Lesbia, Tibullus
his Delia, Propertius Cynthia, and Ovid his Corinna. Π we
ask after Horaee’s lady-love, her name is Legion3 Chloe,
Glycera, Leuconoe, Lyce and Cinara. All these ladies
are perfectly unreal to us. They may have existed, or the
poems in their honour may be simply translations from

and many people have written sentimentally of Horace’s
devotion at least to the latter. But the most one can say
about her is that a few allusions prove her to have been the

Not only the most universal of passions, but those other
feelings which most strongly move mankind are curiously
lacking in Horace. Wifeless and childless‚ he is the club-
man among poets, leading a detached and sels-centred
einstence. Yet to certain emotions his nature was finely
responsive. For Maecenas and for Virgil he had a friend-
ship os no common warmth : and, as befitted the intimate of
Augustus, he had a truly great sense of the greatness of Rome.
Tbese two themes‚ friendship and patriotism, inspire what·
ever is best in the Odes, apart from the mere charm ot
expression3 they alone ronse in him that enthusiasm which
gives him his claim to be in the highest sense of the word
a poet. In any real poetry there must always exist behind
the mere mastery of expression some vis vivida, some
animating energy.

But the thing which has given Horace his place is not
the matter but the formos his work. No great writer was
ever less original than Horace 3 he is, indeed, in this typical

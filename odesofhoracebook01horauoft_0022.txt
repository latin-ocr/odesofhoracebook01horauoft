14 THE ODES OF HORACE.

poems in the first book may date back to his earliest period ,
of literary work. The first book of the Epistles appeared
in 20 B. c.¹ and it contains several references to the resent-
ment expressed by Maecenas at his sterility and his prolonged
absences from Rome. Take back your gifts if you will, says
Horace; Iam grateful for them3 but I cannot sell my
freedom and my right to be idle—liberrima otia ²—for all
the riches of Araby. Moreover, he says, ‘I am too old for
fooling3 philosophy is the proper study for a man of my
years, not poetry. Let me live the contemplative life,’—a
pretty phrase for idleness ³.

Horace speaks with the independence of a man who
knows his own mind and his own value. The intimacy with
Maecenas had led to a friendship hardly less close with
Augustus, who wished to attach Horace to his household as
secretary⁴. The poet, however, declined this confidential
position and remained simply his prince’s favourite guest.
In 17 B.c. a great occasion gave him official recognition as
laureate. Augustus determined to revive the ludi saeculares
or centennial games, observance of which had lapsed. It was
in a sense the jubilee of the principate‚ now fairly and firmly
established as a reign of peace and good order after a
century of war and anarchy: and a central feature of the
games was the great hymn to Phoebus and Diana written by
Horace, and sung under his direction by a chorus of boys

¹ The last Epistle gives the date of the book and of his birth.
Me quater undenos sciat implevisse Decembres
Collegam Lepidum quo (luxit Lollius anna—E. i. 20 fin.

² E. i. 7. 36. The whole Epistle is to this effect.

⁸ Non eadem est aetas, non mens .....
Nunc itaque et versus et cetera ludicra pono,
Quid verum atque decens, curo et rogo et omnis in hoc sum.

E. i. 1. 4 sqq.

⁴ Suet. Vit. Augustus ei epistolarum officium obtulit, ut hoc ad
Maecenatem scripto significat, ‘ Ante ipse scribendis epistolis
amicorum sufficiebam; nunc occupatissimus et infirmus Horatium
nostrum a te cupio abducere. Veniet ergo ab ista parasitica mensa
ad banc regiam et nos in scribendis epistolis iuvabit.
